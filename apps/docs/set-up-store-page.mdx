Your store page is where visitors come to learn about what you offer. It shows details about your product, pricing, answers common questions, and highlights testimonials.

Set up a store page for your business on Whop in less than 5 minutes.

## Complete the store page setup checklist

If you're building your whop for the first time, you'll see a checklist to guide you through setting up your store page.

<Tip>
  Don't overthink your initial setup: You can always come back to improve it later as you learn what works best for your audience.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add title, headline and description" titleSize="h3">
    Your title, headline, and description help visitors understand what you're offering and why they should care.

    To add these:

    1. Click **Add title, headline, and description** in the checklist
    2. In the **Edit details** tab that appears, enter your store name in the **Name** field
       - Keep it simple and easy to remember
       - Choose a name that clearly communicates what you offer
    3. Write a catchy **Headline** that grabs attention
       - Try this simple formula: "[What you help with] for [who you help]"
         - Example: _"Healthy, delicious meals in 15 minutes for busy professionals"_
    4. Write a detailed **Description** that explains
       - What members will get
       - How your product will help a customer
       - Example: "Access weekly meal plans, grocery lists, and step-by-step cooking tutorials that fit your schedule"
    5. Click **Save** when you’re done
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your logo" titleSize="h3">
    Your logo makes your store look professional and helps people recognize your brand.

    To add your logo:

    1. Click **Add logo** in the checklist
    2. Click **Upload logo** to select your logo file from your device
    3. Position and adjust your logo as you like
    4. Click **Save**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add gallery images" titleSize="h3">
    Think of this as your billboard. This image or video sits at the top of your store page and should grab attention right away.

    To add your gallery image(s):

    1. Click **Add gallery images** in the checklist
    2. Click **Upload media** and select the media files you want to show in your gallery
       - You can select up to eight images/videos
       - We recommend uploading images with a 16:9 aspect ratio
    3. Arrange them how you want (the top-left one shows first)
    4. Click **Save**

    <Tip>
      Pro tip: Add a short video (VSL) of yourself talking about your offer to build trust. Even a simple, authentic video can significantly increase conversions compared to images alone.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose category" titleSize="h3">
    Picking the right category helps people find your store when browsing Whop.

    To choose a category:

    1. Click **Choose category** in the checklist
    2. Open the dropdown menu and select the category that best fits what you offer
    3. Click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>
