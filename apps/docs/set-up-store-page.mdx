Your product page is where visitors learn about your offer. It shows details about your product, explains what customers get, and highlights the value.  

##  Complete the store page setup checklist

If you're building your product for the first time, you'll see a checklist to guide you through setting up your page.

<Tip>
  Don't overthink your initial setup: You can always come back to improve it later as you learn what works best for your audience.  
  Changes to your product page are only saved when you click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

  <Step title="Create your product" titleSize="h3">

    3. Choose your **Product type** (e.g., Software, Paid group, Newsletter).

  <Step title="Add product details" titleSize="h3">
   Your product name, headline, and description help visitors quickly understand your offer.

    To add these:

    1. Enter your **Name** (e.g., "Basic Access") — short and clear (max 30 characters).  
    2. Write a catchy **Headline** (max 150 characters) that grabs attention.  
       - Example: _"How to Build a Viral App: $0 to $100k/mo"_  
    3. Write a detailed **Description** (up to 1500 characters) that explains:  
       - What members will get  
       - How your product will help customers  
       - Example: _"Access weekly growth strategies, templates, and tutorials designed to help you scale your app."_

    <Step title="Add product media" titleSize="h3">
    This is where you can upload images or videos that appear at the top of your page.

    To add your media:

    1. Click **Add videos and photos**.  
    2. Select media files from your device (up to eight).  
       - We recommend uploading images with a 16:9 aspect ratio.  
    3. Arrange them in the order you want (the top-left file shows first).  

    <Tip>
      Pro tip: A short video (or VSL) talking about your product improves conversions.

    To add features:

    1. Click **Add a feature**.  
    2. Write short, benefit-driven points (e.g., "Weekly live Q&A calls").  
</Step>
<Step title="Add FAQs" titleSize="h3">
    FAQs help answer common questions before someone buys.  

    To add FAQs:

    1. Click **Add FAQ item…**  
    2. Enter a question and your answer.  
       - Example: _"Do I need prior coding experience?"_ → _"No, this course is beginner-friendly."_

    In the **Advanced** section, you’ll find:
