Your product page is where visitors learn about your offer. It shows details about your product, explains what customers get, and highlights the value.

##  Complete the store page setup checklist

If you’re building your Whop product for the first time, you’ll see a checklist to guide you through setting up your page.

<Tip>
  Don’t overthink your initial setup. You can always come back later to improve it as you learn what works best for your audience.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose product type and category" titleSize="h3">
    Your product type and category help define what you’re selling and how customers find it.

    To set these:

    1. Select your **Product type** (e.g., Paid group).  
    2. Select a **Category** that best matches what you offer.
    3. Click **Save** when done.  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add product details" titleSize="h3">
    Your product name, headline, and description help visitors quickly understand your offer.  

    To add these:  

    1. Enter your **Name** (e.g., “Basic Access”) — short and clear (max 30 characters).
    2.  Write a catchy **Headline** (max 150 characters) that grabs attention.  
     - Example: *“How to Build a Viral App: $0 to $100k/mo”*  
    3. Write a detailed **Description** (up to 1500 characters) that explains:  
       - What members will get  
       - How your product will help customers  
       - Example: *“Access weekly growth strategies, templates, and tutorials designed to help you             scale your app.”*  
    4. Click **Save** when you’re done. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add product media" titleSize="h3">
    This is where you can upload images or videos that appear at the top of your page.  

    To add your media:

    1. Click **Add videos and photos**.  
    2. Select media files from your device (up to eight).  
       - We recommend uploading with a 16:9 aspect ratio.  
    3. Arrange them in the order you want (the top-left file shows first). 
    4. Click **Save**.

    <Tip>
      Pro tip: A short video (VSL) talking about your product improves conversions.  
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set pricing" titleSize="h3">
    Choose how much it costs to join your product. You can offer free, one-time, or recurring        options.  

    To add pricing: 

    1. Select your pricing type (Free, One-time, Recurring).  
    2. Enter the price and currency.
    3. (Optional) Click **Add another pricing option** to create tiers or multiple plans.  
    4. Click **Save**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add features 

Features help highlight the value of your offer and what members will gain.  

To add features:  

1. Click **Add a feature**.  
2. Write short, benefit-driven points (e.g., “Weekly live Q&A calls”).  
3. Click **Save**. 

### Add FAQs
FAQs help answer common questions before someone buys.  

To add FAQs:  

1. Click **Add FAQ item**  
2. Enter a question and your answer.  
   - Example: *“Do I need prior coding experience?”* → *“No, this course is beginner-friendly.”*  
3. Click **Save**.  

### Advanced settings  
In the **Advanced** section, you’ll find:  

- **Visibility toggle**: By default, your product is visible on your public store page. You can toggle this off to hide it from your store page (still accessible via direct link).
