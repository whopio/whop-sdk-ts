## Client websocket

You can connect to the websocket from your client side frontend code running in the whop iframe.
Use this to add real-time features to your app, and receive messages you sent from your server. 

1. Create the websocket client:

	```typescript
	import { WhopClientSdk } from "@whop/api";

	const whopApi = WhopClientSdk();

	const websocket = whopApi.websocketClient({
		joinExperience: "exp_XXXX", // optional, you can join a specific experience channel (ie, the one you are currently viewing).
		joinCustom: "some_custom_channel", // optional, you can join a custom channel.
	});
	```

2. Add event handlers for messages:

	```typescript
	websocket.on("appMessage", (message) => {
		console.log("Received custom message:", message);
		
		// message.isTrusted is true if and only if the message was sent from your server with your private app API key.
		
		// message.json is the JSON string you sent from your server / client.

		// if you sent the message from the client using websocket.broadcast, 
		// message.fromUserId will include the user id of the user who sent the message.
	});
	```

3. Handle connection status changes:

	```typescript
	websocket.on("connectionStatus", (status) => {
		console.log("Websocket Status Updated:", status);
	});

	websocket.on("connect", () => {
		console.log("Websocket Connected");
	});

	websocket.on("disconnect", () => {
		console.log("Websocket Disconnected");
	});
	```

4. Connect to the websocket and start receiving events:

	```typescript
	websocket.connect();
	```

5. _Optional:_ Disconnect from the websocket:

	```typescript
	websocket.disconnect();
	```

## Send messages from the client

You can send messages from the client to the server by using the `websocket.broadcast` function.

1. Create a websocket client as above, and make sure you are connected by calling `websocket.connect()`.

2. Send a custom message via websocket.

	```typescript
	websocket.broadcast({
		message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
		target: "everyone",
	});
	```

	The target field is the same as the one you would pass to `whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage` on the server.

## Send messages from your server

You can broadcast trusted websocket messages from your server to connected clients by using the `whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage` function.

1. Construct an instance of the whop server sdk and pass your API key:

	```typescript
	import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

	const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
		appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
	});
	```

2. Send a custom string message via websocket.

	```typescript
	// Send to all users currently on your app across all experiences / views.
	whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
		message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
		target: "everyone",
	});

	// send to all users currently on this experience
	// (only works if the experience belongs to your app)
	whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
		message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
		target: { experience: "exp_XXXX" },
	});

	// create a custom channel that your websocket client can subscribe to.
	// Only works if when connecting on the client, you pass the same custom channel name.
	whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
		message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
		target: { custom: "some_custom_channel" },
	});

	// send to a specific user on your app
	whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
		message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
		target: { user: "user_XXXX" },
	});
	```


## Receive messages on your server

<Info>Before you start, make sure you are using NodeJS 22.4 or higher, or Bun to run your server.</Info>

Use the server websocket API to receive events such as chat messages as forum posts for a particular user on your server.
You can use these events to build real-time apps such as chat bots and AI-agents that react to events on the platform.

1. Construct (or reuse) an instance of the whop server sdk and pass your API key: 

	```typescript
	import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

	const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
		appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
	});
	```

2. Create your websocket client and add handlers for messages / status changes:

	```typescript
	const websocket = whopApi
		// Pass the user id of the user you want to receive events for
		.withUser("user_v9KUoZvTGp6ID")
		// Construct the websocket client
		.websocketClient();
	```

3. Add event handlers for messages:

	```typescript
	websocket.on("message", (message) => {
		console.log("Received Message:", message);
		
		const chatMessage = message.feedEntity?.dmsPost;
		if (chatMessage) {
			// handle the chat message
		}

		const forumPost = message.feedEntity?.forumPost;
		if (forumPost) {
			// handle the forum post
		}
	});
	```

4. Add event handlers for status changes (same as client API):

	```typescript
	websocket.on("connectionStatus", (status) => {
		console.log("Websocket Status Updated:", status);
	});

	// Or you can also listen to the connect and disconnect events:
	websocket.on("connect", () => {
		console.log("Websocket Connected");
	});

	websocket.on("disconnect", () => {
		console.log("Websocket Disconnected");
	});
	```

5. Connect to the websocket and start receiving events:

	```typescript
	websocket.connect();
	```

6. _Optional:_ Disconnect from the websocket:

	```typescript
	websocket.disconnect();
	```
