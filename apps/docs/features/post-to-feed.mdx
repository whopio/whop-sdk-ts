## Overview

To post in a forum, you must:

1. Find or create a _Forum Experience_
2. Create a _Forum Post_ inside the _Forum Experience_

<Info>
  If you already know what forum experience you want to post in, you can skip
  step 1, and use the experience ID directly in step 2.

## Find or create a forum experience

A forum post must be created within a **Forum Experience**.
The `findOrCreateForum` method will find an existing forum experience with the specified name,
or create a new one with all the specified options

```typescript
await whopApi
  .withUser("user_XXXXXX")
  .withCompany("biz_XXXXXX")
  .findOrCreateForum({
    input: {
      accessPassId: "prod_XXXXXX",
      name: "My App Forum",
      whoCanPost: "everyone",
    },
  });
```

- `accessPassId`: ID of the whop to attach the forum to.
- `name`: Visible title of the forum experience.
- `whoCanPost`: "everyone" or "admins"
- `withUser()`: ID of an admin of the company that owns the access pass.
- `withCompany()`: ID of the company that owns the access pass.

> If you only have an experience ID, you can pass that as `experienceId: "exp_XXX"` instead of `accessPassId`.
> This will create the forum in the same whop as the supplied experience.

## Create a forum post.

Once you have the `experienceId`, use it to create a post.

### Basic Forum Post

```ts
await whopApi
  .withUser("user_XXXXXX")
  .withCompany("biz_XXXXXX")
  .createForumPost({
    input: {
      forumExperienceId: "exp_XXXXXX",
      title: "Welcome!",
      content: "Excited to kick things off in our new forum ðŸŽ‰",
    },
  });
```

- `withUser()`: ID of the user posting
- `withCompany()`: ID of the company that owns the forum experience
- `forumExperienceId`: The ID of the target forum
- `title` and `content`: Main post body. _(title is optional)_

### Forum post with advanced options

This demonstrates a rich post using all features:

```ts
await whopApi
  .withUser("user_XXXXXX")
  .withCompany("biz_XXXXXX")
  .createForumPost({
    input: {
      forumExperienceId: "exp_XXXXXX",

      // Visible even before purchase.
      title: "Big Launch + Community Poll!",

      // Visible only after purchase
      content: "Hidden content unless purchased. ðŸ”’",

      // Add media to the post.
      // Learn how to upload in the upload-media section
      attachments: [
        {
          directUploadId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        },
      ],

      // Send a notification to everyone about this post.
      isMention: true,

      // Lock the content and attachments behind a
      // one time purchase in the price + currency.
      paywallAmount: 9.99,
      paywallCurrency: "usd",

      // Add a poll to the post.
      poll: {
        options: [
          { id: "1", text: "New Product Features" },
          { id: "2", text: "Exclusive AMA" },
          { id: "3", text: "Member Giveaways" },
        ],
      },
    },
  });
```
