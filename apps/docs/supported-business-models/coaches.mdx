  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Forums app" titleSize="h3">
    The **Forums** app is your primary channel for communicating with your students. This is where you’ll share important updates, announcements, and valuable content that all members should see.

    The **Content** app gives you unlimited flexibility to share text-based resources with your community:

  </Step>

    Your store page is where people decide whether to join your whop. A clean, clear page that shows the results you help people achieve will convert more visitors into paying clients. Click your whop name in the top left, then select **Design store page** to open the editor. Click **Edit details** to customize:

    - **Choose a clear name and headline**: Make it immediately obvious what you do and who you help. Examples: "Business coaching for new entrepreneurs ready to get their first clients" or "Fitness coaching for busy people who want to get strong at home"
    - **Write a compelling description**: Focus on the transformation clients will experience and how your coaching helps them reach their goals. Highlight specific benefits like personalized guidance, accountability support, proven frameworks, and measurable results
    - **Upload a clean logo or headshot**: Even a simple logo or professional headshot builds trust and makes your coaching business look established
    - **Add gallery images or video**: A brief welcome video introducing yourself, client success stories, or behind-the-scenes images help potential clients connect with you and understand your coaching approach
    - **Select the appropriate category**: This helps people discover your coaching offer when browsing Whop
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up pricing and Whop Payments" titleSize="h3">
    Here's how to price your services and ensure those payments reach your account.

    1. **Add a pricing option**

    Click your whop name at the top left of your dashboard, select **Manage Pricing**, and then click **Create a pricing option** at the bottom right of the popup. You can structure your pricing as free access, a one-time payment, or a recurring subscription - whatever works for your coaching model. For example:

    - **Free access:** Clients get access to your whop for free. You can then charge members to pay for 1-on-1 sessions with you through the **Calendar Bookings** app
    - **Monthly subscription**: Set as recurring payments for unlimited access to all apps and resources, plus included sessions. You can choose any billing cycle that works for your coaching - monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or yearly.

    2. **Set up Whop Payments**

    Follow these steps to make sure your profit hits your bank:

    - Go to your **Dashboard**
    - Go to **Payouts**
    - Click **Set up Whop Payments**
    - Select your country so payouts are in your local currency
    - Complete the Stripe-powered setup (fill in your details, link your bank, and upload ID)

    The whole process only takes a few minutes. After that, you’re ready to get paid.
