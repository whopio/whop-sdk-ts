If you have an existing SaaS or are building a new one, you can use Whop to direct your customers to pay and let them manage their membership.

To integrate, all you have to do is adjust your `User` table to include the `whop_user_id` and `whop_username` columns.

| Column          | Type   | Description                                                |
| --------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `whop_user_id`  | string | Unique identifier for the user provided by Whop.           |
| `whop_username` | string | The user's Whop username, helpful for display and logging. |

**Note**
Use the Whop SDKâ€™s `access.checkIfUserHasAccessToAccessPass` method (shown in Step&nbsp;6) by passing the `whop_user_id` and the relevant access&nbsp;pass (product) ID to determine whether the user should be allowed to access your software.

If you would prefer to not have manage your own user table or even a database, consider building a Whop app here.

## Get your SaaS live on Whop:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your whop" titleSize="h3">
    Head over to [**whop.com/sell**](https://whop.com/dashboard/start/):

    - Choose a name for your SaaS
    - Select your custom URL
    - Complete the basic setup

    Your whop is now live and ready to customize.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a product" titleSize="h3">
	- Go to your Dashboard
	- Go to Products
	- Click Add Product

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add checkout link to your website" titleSize="h3">
    There are two primary ways to send customers to checkout: an embedded checkout or a hosted checkout link.

    ### Embedded checkout

    Follow these two steps to embed the checkout on your page. First, include the Whop Checkout loader script:

    ```html
    <!-- Step 1 â€“ Include the Whop Checkout loader -->
    <script
      async
      defer
      src="https://js.whop.com/static/checkout/loader.js"
    ></script>
    ```

    Then, add the checkout element where you want it to appear. Replace `plan_XXXXXXXXX` with your actual plan ID from the dashboard.

    ```html
    <!-- Step 2 â€“ Add the checkout element -->
    <div data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
    ```

    ### Hosted checkout link

    Alternatively, you can link customers to Whopâ€™s hosted checkout page. You can get this link from your dashboard or generate one programmatically and link to the `checkoutUrl` it returns (as shown in Step 6).

    ```html
    <!-- Hosted checkout link -->
    <a href="https://whop.com/checkout/plan_xxxxxxxxx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Buy now
    </a>
    ```

If you would like to programatically create a checkout session, you can do so with the following code:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript pages/api/create-checkout-session.ts
import { whopSdk } from "~/lib/whop-sdk";

export async function createCheckoutSession(experienceId: string) {
  const checkoutSession = await whopSdk.payments.createCheckoutSession({
    planId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PLAN_ID!,
    metadata: {
      customKey: "customValue",
    },
  });

  return checkoutSession;
}
```

When you receive the webhook (see below), you can use the `metadata` object to access the custom key and value you attached to the checkout session.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add an app and get API keys" titleSize="h3">
	Go to your dashboard and add app

  </Step>
  <Step title="Subscribe to webhooks" titleSize="h3">
    Go to the dashboard section and add a webhook.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for access programatically" titleSize="h3">

<CodeGroup>

```typescript lib/whop-sdk.ts
import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

// Instantiate the Whop SDK client.
// ðŸ‘‰ Replace the ENV vars below with the ones from your Whop dashboard.
export const whopSdk = WhopServerSdk({
  // Required: your App ID ("App Settings" â†’ App ID)
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID!,

  // Required: the API key you generated in "API Keys"
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY!,
});
```

```typescript pages/api/validate-access.ts
import { whopSdk } from "~/lib/whop-sdk";

// Validate that a signed-in user has access to your premium product before
// letting them use your SaaS feature.
export async function validateAccess(whopUserId: string) {
  const result = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToAccessPass({
    // Access Pass / Product ID you want to gate behind
    accessPassId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_ACCESS_PASS_ID!,
    // The Whop user we stored in our database
    userId: whopUserId,
  });

  return result.hasAccess; // boolean
}
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Give users a way to manage their membership" titleSize="h3">
  	You can link users here to manage their membership: https://whop.com/@me/settings/memberships/.
	
	They can simply login with the same email and they use to access your SaaS without a password.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design your store page and list on marketplace" titleSize="h3">
    Your store page is where people can learn about your offer. Click your whop name in the top left, then select **Design store page** to open the editor. Click **Edit details** to customize:

    - **Choose a clear name and headline:** Make it immediately obvious what your community offers and who it's for. Examples: "Marketing professionals sharing strategies and insights" or "Fitness enthusiasts building accountability and motivation"
    - **Write a compelling description:** Focus on the value members receive and how your community will help them achieve their goals. Highlight specific benefits like exclusive content, expert guidance, peer connections, and ongoing support
    - **Upload a logo:** Add a clean, simple logo to your store page
    - **Add gallery images or video:** Images of events, member success stories, or a brief welcome video help potential members get to know you and what to expect when they join
    - **Select the appropriate category:** This helps people discover your community when browsing Whop
