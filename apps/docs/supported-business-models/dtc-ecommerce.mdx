We're still working on making Whop a better place to sell physical products. In the meantime, many creators use Whop to accept payments and bring social features to their stores.

## Sell a physical product on Whop in 4 simple steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a product for your item" titleSize="h3">
    Go to your whop > click **Products** > **Add product**. Name your product
    and write a catchy headline so buyers know what to expect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick your price" titleSize="h3">
    Choose a one-time price. If you offer refills or memberships, you can also
    use recurring pricing. You can always adjust later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up fulfillment" titleSize="h3">
    Set up webhooks with [**Zapier**](https://zapier.com) to trigger your order
    fulfillment (e.g., create a shipment, notify your 3PL, or send confirmation
    emails). In the meantime, use custom fields on the pricing option to collect
    what you need to fulfill (e.g., shipping address, size, color).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share your link with buyers" titleSize="h3">
    Copy your product checkout link and share it anywhereâ€”your website, socials,
    email, or DMs.
  </Step>
