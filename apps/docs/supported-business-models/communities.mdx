    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design your store page" titleSize="h3">
    Your store page is where potential members decide whether to join your community. A clear, professional page that focuses on member benefits will convert more visitors into paying members. Click your whop name in the top left, then select **Design store page** to open the editor. Click **Edit details** to customize:

    - **Choose a clear name and headline:** Make it immediately obvious what your community offers and who it's for. Examples: "Marketing professionals sharing strategies and insights" or "Fitness enthusiasts building accountability and motivation"
    - **Write a compelling description:** Focus on the value members receive and how your community will help them achieve their goals. Highlight specific benefits like exclusive content, expert guidance, peer connections, and ongoing support
    - **Upload a clean logo:** Even a simple logo builds trust and makes your community look established
    - **Add gallery images or video:** Images of events, member success stories, or a brief welcome video help potential members get to know you and what to expect when they join.
    - **Select the appropriate category:** This helps people discover your community when browsing Whop.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up pricing and Whop Payments" titleSize="h3">
    Alright, you’ve built your community. Now let’s make it a business. Here’s how to price your community and make sure those payments hit your account.

    1. **Add a pricing option**

    Click your whop name at the top left of your dashboard, select **_Manage Pricing_**, and then click **_Create a pricing option_** at the bottom right of the popup. Many communities choose a recurring fee (i.e. a subscription model) - for example:

    - **\$30/month** for full access
    - **\$200/year** for a yearly pass

    To do this, select **_Recurring_** when creating your pricing and select weekly or monthly. You can also add multiple pricing options (for example, a weekly plan, a monthly plan, and a lifetime membership). Don't overthink this - you can update or change your pricing as your community grows.

    <Tip>
      Pro tip: Most of the largest communities on Whop use a free \+ premium model. This means setting up two 'Products' in your whop - one that's free to join, and another with paid access to premium apps (like chats, courses and resources).
    </Tip>
    2. **Set up Whop Payments**

    Follow these steps to make sure your income hits your bank:

    - Go to your **Dashboard**
    - Go to **Payouts**
    - Click **Set up Whop Payments**
    - Select your country so payouts are in your local currency
    - Complete the Stripe-powered setup (fill in your details, link your bank, and upload ID)

    The whole process only takes a few minutes. After that, you’re ready to get paid. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your whop is ready, now go build your community\!
