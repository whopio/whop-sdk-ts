You can manage lead generation, take sales calls, showcase case studies, run private client portals, handle payments, and coordinate your team - all in Whop.

Here's how to set it all up:

## How it works

You'll use your whop as both your lead generation funnel and your client delivery system. Here's how:

**For prospects:** You'll create a free whop where they can view your case studies, access helpful resources, and book sales calls directly with you.

**For clients:** You can handle all payments through Whop and send private checkout links. After they hire you, you'll give them access to private project spaces where you can communicate, share deliverables, and manage timelines.

## Launch your agency on Whop in 9 steps

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Calendar Bookings app" titleSize="h3">
    Just like Calendly, this app allows you to set up your calendar so prospects can schedule discovery calls and sales calls with you.

    1. Add the **Calendar Bookings** app from the Whop App Store, then click **Configure Calendar Bookings** to set up your availability
    2. Click **Add availability** or **\+** at the top right
    3. Add the: 
       - **Title** 
       - **Duration** 
       - **Meeting link/Location**
       - You can optionally add a **Description** and a **Price per booking**
    4. Click **Continue**
    5. Select the **Days** and **Time** you’ll be available
    6. Click **Create**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Files app" titleSize="h3">
    Give prospects access to high value materials before they hop on calls - your whop is essentially your lead magnet. Add the **Files** app multiple times from the Whop App Store and rename accordingly. Here are a few ways to use the **Files** app:

    - **Case studies:** Upload your best client work, before/after results, and success stories
    - **Legal docs:** Share your scope of work, terms of service, and service breakdown so prospects know what to expect
    - **Free resources:** Include templates, audits, checklists, or guides as lead magnets to provide immediate value
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Content app" titleSize="h3">
    The **Content** app gives you unlimited flexibility to share text-based resources with your prospects.

    - Welcome guide explaining how prospects can get the most value from your whop
    - FAQ section answering common questions about your services
    - Your methodology or approach to solving client problems
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Chat app (optional)" titleSize="h3">
    Consider adding a community element to your whop where prospects can ask questions, engage with your content, and stay connected with your agency. Add the **Chat** app from the Whop App Store and rename it to "Ask questions" or "General chat". This creates a space where prospects can:

    - Ask questions about your area of expertise
    - Get quick answers and build trust with your agency
    - Connect with other prospects (creates social proof)
    - Stay engaged with your content and updates

    <Tip>
      Stay active in the chat to build relationships and demonstrate your expertise. Answer questions quickly and share valuable insights - this positions you as helpful and knowledgeable before prospects even book a call.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up a free pricing model" titleSize="h3">
    Now that you've added your apps, create a free product that gives prospects access to everything.

    - Go to your whop \> click **Products** \> click **Add product**

    Configure the settings in the product to make it free to access.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Design your store page" titleSize="h3">
    Your store page is where prospects decide whether to join your free whop. Click your whop name in the top left, then select **Design store page** to open the editor. Click **Edit details** to customize:

    - **Choose a clear name and headline:** Make it immediately obvious what your agency offers and who it's for
    - **Write a compelling description:** Focus on the results you deliver for clients
    - **Upload a clean logo:** Even a simple logo builds credibility and makes your agency look legit
    - **Add gallery images or video:** Include case study screenshots, client testimonials, or a brief welcome video that builds trust and showcases your expertise
    - **Select "Agencies" as your category:** This helps people discover your services when browsing Whop
  </Step>
  <Step title="Convert leads into paying clients" titleSize="h3">
    When someone books a call through your **Calendar Bookings** app and decides to work with you, you can create a paid product (and checkout link) for them. When you close a client, you have two options:

    ### Option A: Use Whop for payment processing only

    Choose this option if you just want to handle the payment through Whop and manage everything else with your current tools.

    - Create a new product specifically for that client
    - [Set your pricing](/apps/docs/set-up-products-pricing) (one-time project fee or recurring retainer)
    - Don't toggle on any apps for this product
    - Send them the private checkout link to complete payment
    - Manage project delivery through your existing tools

    ### Option B: Create a complete client portal

    Give your client a dedicated space inside your whop where you can communicate and share project materials.

    - Create a new paid product for the client
    - [Set your pricing structure](/apps/docs/set-up-products-pricing)
    - Add apps in your whop that are only accessible to this client:
      - **Chat**: Private 1:1 communication channel
      - **Files**: Upload deliverables, contracts, and assets
      - **Events**: Schedule review sessions, deadlines, and milestones
      - **Content**: Share project briefs, strategy documents, or progress updates
      - **Calendar**: Allow clients to book additional calls or check-ins
    - Hide this product from your public store page
    - Send the private checkout link after your sales call
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage your team" titleSize="h3">
    As your agency grows, you can add team members.

    - [Learn more about managing your team, roles and permissions here](/apps/docs/manage-your-whop/manage-team-roles).

    You can even pay your team through whop.

    - [Learn how to pay your team on Whop here](/apps/docs/manage-your-whop/pay-your-team).

    Add internal apps that are only accessible to your team members to keep your operations running smoothly.

    - **Files**: Store SOPs, templates, and internal documentation
    - **Chat**: Create team communication channels
    - **Events**: Schedule team meetings and deadlines
    - **Calendar**: Allow team members to book 1-on-1s with you
  </Step>
