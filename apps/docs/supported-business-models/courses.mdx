    You can structure your pricing as free access, a one-time payment, or a recurring subscription:

    - **Free**: Make it free to access your course (then upsell a higher ticket offer or done-for-you services)
    - **One-time payment**: For example, \$297 for lifetime access to your complete course
    - **Subscription model**: For example, \$47/month for ongoing access (with new content added regularly)

## Setting up your Courses app

Now that you've set up the basic structure of your course business, let's dive deeper into how to use the **Courses** app.

### Understanding the course structure

Your course is built using a three-level hierarchy to help organize your content:

1. **Modules**: These are your main course topics. Think "Beginner basics," "Advanced techniques," "Bonus resources," or "Live call recordings."
2. **Chapters**: These break each module into smaller, bite-sized sections that are easier to follow. Each chapter should focus on a specific subtopic or learning objective that builds toward the module's overall goal.
3. **Lessons:** This is where you actually teach - each lesson is one video, PDF, quiz, or piece of content (more info on this below).

### Types of lessons you can create

The **Courses** app gives you flexibility in how you deliver your content:

    Combine text, video, and downloads in one comprehensive lesson.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Video" icon="camera-movie">
    Upload or embed videos that students can watch at their own pace.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text" icon="Pencil">
    Written guides and step-by-step instructions with rich formatting.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="PDF" icon="clipboard-check">
    Share downloadable worksheets, templates, and reference materials.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge check" icon="check">
    Ungraded questions that help students self-assess their progress.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quiz" icon="question">
    Graded tests to certify student mastery before they advance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Course settings

In the **Settings** panel for each module, you can customize how students experience your content:

- **Description**: Add context about what students will learn in this specific module.
- **Require lesson completion**: Toggle this on to create a structured learning path where students must complete lessons in order. This ensures they don't skip ahead and miss important foundational concepts.
- **Video protection**: Add unique overlays to your videos to prevent unauthorized sharing and protect your intellectual property.
- **Completion certificates**: Generate professional certificates when students finish your course. This is especially valuable for professional development courses and adds perceived value to your offering.
- **Language settings**: Set the language for closed captions to make your content accessible to a broader audience.
