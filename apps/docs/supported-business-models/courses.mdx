  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Content app" titleSize="h3">
    Use the [**Content**](https://whop.com/apps/app_mmjPLOxIgL1qxe/install/) app to create a "Start here" guide that helps new students get oriented and know exactly what to do first. Create a welcome guide that covers:

    - How to navigate your whop and find everything
    - Where to begin with your course content
    - How to ask questions and get support
    - Any introductions or first steps they should take

    This simple orientation saves you from answering the same questions over and over, and helps students feel confident from day one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Forums app" titleSize="h3">
    The [**Forums**](https://whop.com/apps/app_dYfm2IdXhDMquv/install/) app is your primary channel for communicating with your students. This is where you’ll share important updates, announcements, and valuable content that all members should see. Add the **Forums** app to your whop and rename it to match your communication needs. Popular forum uses include:

    - **Announcements**: Share course updates, new lesson releases, and important information
    - **Weekly insights**: Post regular tips, industry updates, or motivational content
    - **Student wins**: Highlight student success stories and achievements to inspire others
    - **Q&A discussions**: Answer student questions and encourage peer-to-peer learning

    <Tip>
      You can add the Forums app multiple times to keep different types of discussions organized.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add the Chat app" titleSize="h3">
    Give your students a place to connect, ask quick questions, and support each other's learning journey. The community aspect often becomes just as valuable as the course content itself. Add [**Chat**](https://whop.com/apps/app_xml5hbizmZPgUT/install/) apps and customize them for your course community:

    - **General chat**: Main conversation space for course-related discussions
    - **Introductions**: Help new students connect and share their learning goals
    - **Assignment submissions**: Create spaces for students to share their work and get feedback

    <Tip>
      Add multiple Chat apps to create separate spaces for different topics or student cohorts.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design your store page" titleSize="h3">
    Your store page is where potential students decide whether to enroll in your course. Click your whop name in the top left, then select **Design store page** to open the editor. Click **Edit details** to customize:

    - **Choose a clear name and headline**: Make it immediately obvious what students will learn and how it will benefit them. Examples: "Master Facebook Ads in 30 Days" or "Complete Python Programming Bootcamp"
    - **Write a compelling description**: Focus on the transformation students will experience and specific skills they'll gain. Highlight outcomes like "land your first coding job," "double your ad ROI," or "launch your consulting business"
    - **Upload a clean logo**: Even a simple logo builds credibility and makes your course look pro
    - **Add gallery images or video**: Include a course preview video, screenshots of your content, or student testimonials to build trust and show what's inside
    - **Select the appropriate category**: This helps people discover your course when browsing Whop
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up pricing and Whop Payments" titleSize="h3">
    You've built your course. Now let's make it profitable. Here's how to price your course and ensure those payments reach your account.

    1. **Add a pricing option**

    Click your whop name at the top left of your dashboard, select **Manage Pricing**, and then click **Create a pricing option** at the bottom right of the popup. You can structure your pricing as free access, a one-time payment, or a recurring subscription:

    - **Free**: Make it free to access your course, then upsell a higher ticket offer or done-for-you services
    - **One-time payment**: For example, \$297 for lifetime access to your complete course
    - **Subscription model**: For example, \$47/month for ongoing access with new content added regularly

    <Tip>
      You can also create multiple pricing tiers (for example, a basic course, premium with bonuses, and VIP with 1-on-1 coaching). Start simple - you can always add more options as your business grows.
    </Tip>
    2. **Set up Whop Payments**

    Follow these steps to make sure your profit hits your bank:

    - Go to your **Dashboard**
    - Go to **Payouts**
    - Click **Set up Whop Payments**
    - Select your country so payouts are in your local currency
    - Complete the Stripe-powered setup (fill in your details, link your bank, and upload ID)

    The whole process only takes a few minutes. After that, you’re ready to get paid. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting up your Courses app

Now that you've set up the basic structure of your course business, let's dive deeper into how you can use the **Courses** app.

### Understanding the course structure

Your course is built using a simple three-level hierarchy that makes it easy to organize even the most complex topics:

1. **Modules**: These are your main course topics. Think "Beginner basics," "Advanced techniques," "Bonus resources," or "Live call recordings."
2. **Chapters**: These break each module into smaller, bite-sized sections that are easier to follow. Each chapter should focus on a specific subtopic or learning objective that builds toward the module's overall goal.
3. **Lessons:** This is where you actually teach - each lesson is one video, PDF, quiz, or piece of content (more info on this below).

### Types of lessons you can create

The **Courses** app gives you flexibility in how you deliver your content:

  <Card title="Multimedia" icon="sparkles">
    Combine text, video, and downloads in one comprehensive lesson.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Video" icon="camera-movie">
    Upload or embed videos that students can watch at their own pace.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Text" icon="Pencil">
    Written guides and step-by-step instructions with rich formatting.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="PDF" icon="clipboard-check">
    Share downloadable worksheets, templates, and reference materials.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge check" icon="check">
    Ungraded questions that help students self-assess their progress.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quiz" icon="question">
    Graded tests to certify student mastery before they advance.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Course settings

In the **Settings** panel for each module, you can customize how students experience your content:

- **Description**: Add context about what students will learn in this specific course. This helps set expectations and motivates students to complete the content.
- **Require lesson completion**: Toggle this on to create a structured learning path where students must complete lessons in order. This ensures they don't skip ahead and miss important foundational concepts.
- **Video protection**: Add unique overlays to your videos to prevent unauthorized sharing and protect your intellectual property.
- **Completion certificates**: Generate professional certificates when students finish your course. This is especially valuable for professional development courses and adds perceived value to your offering.
- **Language settings**: Set the language for closed captions to make your content accessible to a broader audience.

Your whop is ready. Now go find your students\!
