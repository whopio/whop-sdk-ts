## Adding **Sign in with Whop**

If you would like to give your users a better experience, add a way for them to authenticate if they originally purchased from Whop. First, you will need to send your users to the **Whop OAuth Portal**. You can do this by having the user click a login button, which might look something like this:

```javascript
<a
  href={`https://whop.com/oauth?client_id=${process.env.CLIENT_ID}&redirect_uri=${process.env.REDIRECT_URI}`}
>
  <button>Login with Whop</button>
</a>
```

<Note>
  To get your Client ID, head to the [Whop Developer
  Settings](https://dash.whop.com/settings/developer) page.
</Note>

After being redirected, the user will be prompted to sign in with their existing Whop account, or create a new one.

## Redirect URL

After the user has signed in, they will be redirected to the URL you specified in the `redirect_uri` query parameter. The URL will also contain a `code` query parameter, which you can use to get the user's access token.
