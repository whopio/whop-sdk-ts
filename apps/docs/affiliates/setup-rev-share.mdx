**Revenue share affiliates** are designed for **strategic partnerships** where revenue is shared at the **transactional level** rather than through traditional referral links.

With revenue share, you can define exactly **who receives a portion of revenue** on a **per-product basis**. The split is calculated **after all Whop fees** are applied, ensuring full transparency and accurate revenue sharing. Once a transaction is completed, the rev share partner’s portion is **automatically deposited into their Whop balance** via Whop Payments — no manual processing required.
