**Custom affiliates** are fully controlled by your business. You can create and manage personalized affiliate deals for closers, influencers, communities, or partners you work with directly. These deals can be configured for **one-time** or **recurring** payouts on a flat fee or % basis, allowing you to tailor commissions based on your business model and marketing strategy.

Affiliates in your custom program also get a **unique referral link** once invited, allowing them to start promoting your business immediately. These links automatically track conversions and handle payouts, ensuring a seamless and transparent process for both you and your partners.
