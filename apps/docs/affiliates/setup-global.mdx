**Global affiliates** are the default way Whop promotes your business across the **Whop Discover marketplace**. Once your product is listed, it’s automatically available for promotion with a **30%** default commission by any affiliate in Whop’s network — no setup required.

Affiliates can instantly get a **unique referral link** with just **one click**, allowing them to begin promoting your business right away. These links track conversions and payouts automatically, so you can benefit from increased exposure and new sales without any additional effort.

Businesses can also set a **custom global commission rate** for **users who have already purchased a membership** to their existing offer. This gives your most engaged customers an opportunity to become affiliates themselves.
