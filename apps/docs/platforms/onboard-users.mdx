  follow the below flow to pay your users and optionally give them embedded
  fintech.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Step 1: Pay users from your platform account">

```ts
// pseudo-code
const whop = new Whop({ apiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY });

const company = await whop.payUser({
  name: "",
  user: "steven@google.com", // this will create an account for the user if it does not yet exist
  description: "Payout for creating content",
});

const companyId = company.id;

saveCompanyIdInDatabaseOnCurrentUser(companyId);
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Render the user payouts portal in your application">

### Option A — Deep link to Whop

Fastest approach. Link your sellers to their manage their dashbaord Whop in a new tab.

```md
<a href="https://whop.com/@me/balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View balance</a>
```

### Option B — Iframe embed (pseudo)

Render an iframe pointing to a balance view you control that calls Whop’s APIs server-side.

```tsx
// React pseudo-code
<iframe src="https://whop.com/embedded/payouts/[userId]" />
```

### Option C — Pull data using Whop API

<Note>
  If you want more control or customization, you can always use [our
  API](/api/getting-started) to pull data about sellers on your platform.
