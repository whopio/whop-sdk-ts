<Note>
  After a seller signs up on your platform (you own auth and profile UI), you
  can follow the below flow to start earning a take rate on your sellers.
</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Step 1: Create a `Company` via our API">
<Note>
  Each company that is created using your API keys will be a platform managed
  company.
</Note>

```ts
// pseudo-code
const whop = new Whop({ apiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY });

const company = await whop.company.create({
  name: "",
  seller_email: "steven@google.com", // this will create an account for the seller
  description: "Access to premium features",
  take_rate: 20, // your platform will earn 20% of all revenue collected by your sellers
});

const companyId = company.id;

saveCompanyIdInDatabaseOnCurrentUser(companyId);
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 2: Render the dashboard or balance page in your application">

### Option A — Deep link to Whop

Fastest approach. Link your sellers to their manage their dashbaord Whop in a new tab.

```md
<a href="https://whop.com/@me/balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View balance</a>
```

### Option B — Iframe embed (pseudo)

Render an iframe pointing to a balance view you control that calls Whop’s APIs server-side.

```tsx
// React pseudo-code
<iframe src="https://whop.com/embedded/dashboard/[bizId]" />
```

### Option C — Pull data using Whop API

<Note>
  If you want more control or customization, you can always use [our
  API](/api/getting-started) to pull data about sellers on your platform.
</Note>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Step 3: Create products and checkout sessions [Optional]">
<Note>
  If you embed the dashboard, your sellers can create products directly from that UI on your own website or app.
</Note>

```ts
// pseudo-code
const whop = new Whop({ apiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY });

const company = await whop.products.create({
  name: "1-1 Coaching",
  description: "Access to premium features",
  company_id: companyId,
});

// create a plan
const company = await whop.plans.create({
  name: "1-1 Coaching",
  description: "Access to premium features",
  company_id: companyId,
  take_rate: 20, // your platform account will receive 20% of the transaction
});

// redirect to checkout link or embed checkout directly on your site
```
