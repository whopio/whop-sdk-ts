# What are Whop Apps?

A Whop app is a web app that can be embedded into a whop community. These apps can be installed by any Whop creator through our [app store](https://whop.com/discover/apps). As the developer, you can charge for the app using several options offered by our Whop SDK. Our Whop SDK makes it easy to leverage the infrastructure of whop, to build full-blown apps in hours, not weeks.

# Examples of apps

# Why build Whop apps?

## Distribution
You will be placed in the Whop App Store. The app store is visited by thousands of creators who are looking to offer more value to their communities. You focus on building the best app you can, and we will handle getting you customers.

## Authentication
Zero authentication required. Since your app is embedded into a whop, we handle all user authentication for you. You have access to a load of user information via the Whop SDK.

## Payments
Tap into the power of Whop's payment system. Accept payment with extremely low effort. Here are the different ways to collect payments:

### Transaction fees

Enable in-app purchases and take a transaction fee on each sale. For example, selling game credits, running a watch marketplace, or letting creators sell custom t-shirts.

### Installation fee

Charge a one-time installation fee of $5000 and let Whop creators offer your app as a free benefit for joining their community.

### Per seat

Charge $1 per member inside of a whop and let creators offer your app as a free benefit for joining their community

### Monthly subscription

Charge Whop creators $300 per month to let their members use your app freely.

### Affiliate commission

Let whop creators sell your app inside their community for $29/month and earn a referral fee for every customer they bring you.
