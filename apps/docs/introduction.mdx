# What are Whop Apps?

A Whop app is a web app that can be embedded into a whop community. These apps can be installed by any Whop creator through our [app store](https://whop.com/discover/app-store/). As the developer, you can charge for the app using several options offered by our Whop SDK. Our Whop SDK makes it easy to leverage the infrastructure of whop, to build full-blown apps in hours, not weeks.
