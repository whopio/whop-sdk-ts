  3. Copy the **App ID** - you'll need this for `WHOP_APP_ID`

</Steps>

## 5. Configure Environment Variables

<Steps>
<Step title="Copy Environment Template">
  ```bash
  cp env.example .env
  ```
</Step>

<Step title="Fill in Required Variables">
  Open `.env` in your text editor and fill in these required fields:

```env
# Database Configuration (Required)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST]:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/postgres"

# AI Service Configuration (Required)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key_here"
OPENROUTER_MODEL="google/gemini-2.0-flash-001"

# Whop Integration (Required)
WHOP_APP_API_KEY="your_whop_app_api_key_here"
WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID="your_bot_user_id_here"
WHOP_APP_ID="your_whop_app_id_here"

<Info>All other variables are optional and have sensible defaults.</Info>

</Step>
</Steps>

## 6. Set up the Database

Push the database schema to Supabase:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This will create the necessary tables:

- `companies` - Store bot settings for each Whop company
- `experience_mappings` - Map Whop experiences to companies

## 7. Install Whop Dev Proxy

For Whop integration to work in development, you need to install the Whop dev proxy globally:

```bash
npm install @whop-apps/dev-proxy -g
```

<Note>
  The Whop dev proxy is required for the iframe integration to work properly
  during development.
</Note>

## 8. Run the Application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the Web Server with Whop Proxy">
    Run this command to start both the Whop proxy and Next.js development server:

    ```bash
    whop-proxy --command 'npx next dev --turbopack'
    ```

    You should see output indicating both the proxy and Next.js are running. The web app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

    <Warning>
      Do NOT use `npm run dev` alone - it won't include the Whop proxy and the iframe integration won't work!
    </Warning>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start the AI Bot (New Terminal)">
    In a new terminal window:

    ```bash
    npm run bot
    ```

    You should see:
    ```
    ðŸš€ Starting Whop AI Bot...

    Features:
      â€¢ Smart AI question detection
      â€¢ Admin-only configuration
      â€¢ Real-time responses

    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

    1. Go to your Whop app dashboard â†’ **Developer** â†’ Your App
    2. In the **Hosting** section, configure:
