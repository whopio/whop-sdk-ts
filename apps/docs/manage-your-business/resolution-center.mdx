The Resolution center is your go-to place for handling refund requests from customers.

## What is the Resolution center?

The Resolution center is where you can approve or deny refund requests from your customers. It's a chat space that helps you and your customers work things out before they turn into disputes.

### Why use the Resolution center?

- You stay in control of refund decisions
- Talk directly with customers to fix issues
- Avoid expensive chargeback fees
- Build trust by being open about solving problems

The main goal is to handle refund requests fairly and quickly.

## How to respond to a Resolution center case

When a customer asks for a refund, you'll get an email and need to respond through your dashboard.

**To respond to a case:**

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Resolution center**
2. Click the case you want to resolve
3. Click **Accept**, **Deny**, or **Request more info**

You can upload any proof in your response, so make sure to have solid Terms of Service and Return policy.

<Tip>
  Cases without a response for 7 days are sent to Whop's team automatically. Responding fast shows you care and helps keep customers happy.

## How the Resolution center works

Here's what happens step by step:

1. **Customer opens a claim**
   - Customers can open claims
   - They pick the issue type and explain what's wrong
   - They can upload up to three files (screenshots, videos, receipts, etc.)
2. **You receive a notification**
   - Whop sends you an email when a claim opens
   - The case shows up in your Resolution center
3. **Communication and resolution**
   - The Resolution center becomes your chat space
   - You can **Accept**, **Deny**, or **Request more info**

<Info>
  Whop automatically uploads user logs for every case. In these, you can see:

  - When the user bought access to your Whop
  - If they agreed to your Terms of Service and Refund policy
  - If they claimed access to your Whop
  - If they engaged with your Whop
</Info>

## Set up auto respond

You can set up automatic refunds for smaller amounts when customers request them.

**To set up auto respond:**

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Resolution center**
2. Click **Auto respond**
3. Pick the amount for which auto-refunds are sent:
   - This can be set under **Auto-refund card payments below**
   - And **Auto-refund PayPal payments below**
4. (Optional) Add a custom message your customers will see when they get auto-refunded

## Understanding case escalation and appeals

**Automatic escalation**

If you don't respond within seven days, Whop's team steps in.

We will:

- Look at info from both sides
- Make a fair decision based on what we see
- Tell both you and the customer what we decided

**Appeal process**

If either you or your customer disagrees with a decision:

- Either person can appeal
- Whop's team takes another look
- That decision is final

## Managing email notifications

Whop keeps you in the loop with emails when:

- A customer opens a new dispute
- A customer replies to your request for more info
- A case's status changes (resolved, escalated, appealed)
- Final decisions are made

If you're not getting emails from the Resolution center, go to **Dashboard** \> **Settings** \> **Notifications** and turn on the Resolution center toggle.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many cases can a customer open?">
    Customers can open a case within 120 days of each payment they've made. For example, if a customer has made three payments, they can open three cases. However, only one case can be opened per payment. Once a case is closed and all appeals have been exhausted, the case cannot be reopened.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a customer open a case for a payment that has already been refunded?">
    No, they cannot. If the payment has been refunded, the customer does not have a reason to open a case.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are all payments eligible for the Resolution center?">
    Only fiat payments are eligible for the Resolution center. Payments made with cryptocurrency via Coinbase Commerce are not eligible since they are irreversible and non-refundable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when Whop decides in favor of the customer?">
    Whop will either refund the customer on your behalf (which will be automatically processed) or decide to credit the customer's Whop Balance (which you do not incur a cost for). The result will be clearly communicated to you and the customer through the Resolution center timeline for the case.
