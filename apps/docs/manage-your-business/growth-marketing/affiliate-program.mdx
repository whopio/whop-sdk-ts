Set up your affiliate program to automatically pay commissions when someone refers a new paying member to your whop.

## How the affiliate program works

When someone uses a referral link to join your whop and makes a purchase, the person who referred them earns a commission.

Here's how it works:

- You turn on the affiliate program
- Users get access to their unique affiliate link for your whop
- They share their link anywhere they want
- When someone joins through their link, Whop automatically tracks the referral and pays the commission
- You can customize commission rates anytime to fit your business model

## How to set up your affiliate program

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to your affiliate settings" titleSize="h3">
    To find your affiliate program:

    1. Go to your **Dashboard**
    2. Make sure you're viewing the correct whop using the selection modal at the top left
    3. Click the **Marketing** dropdown
    4. Select **Affiliates**

  </Step>
  <Step title=" Set commission rates for your whop" titleSize="h3">
    1. Click **Set the affiliate commission for a specific whop**
    2. You'll see all your whops with two key settings:
       - **Global affiliate rate:** This is the commission rate offered to any user who refers others to your whop. The default is 30%, but you can adjust it to any percentage you prefer
       - **Member affiliate rate:** This is the commission rate specifically for your existing members who refer others. This allows you to reward your community differently than general affiliates (e.g. members get 50% commission while the global rate is 30%)

    <Tip>
      If you set the 'Member affiliate rate' to 0%, members will earn the global affiliate rate instead.
