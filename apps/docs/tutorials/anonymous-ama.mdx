## Summary

This tutorial guides you through setting up and deploying a full-featured Anonymous Ask Me Anything (AMA) app integrated with the Whop ecosystem. Users can submit anonymous questions, and admins can answer them, automatically creating forum posts.

**ðŸŽ® [Test Live App in your whop](https://whop.com/apps/app_lAgURr4dDAesot/install/)** | **ðŸ“¦ [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Yohanan-Negash/ama-whop-app)**


### Step 1: Setup Your Next.js project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yohanan-Negash/ama-whop-app
cd ama-whop-app
```

Install Dependencies:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pnpm
pnpm install
```
```bash npm
npm install
```
```bash yarn
yarn install
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2: Set up Supabase Database

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Supabase and Create Project">
    1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
    2. Click **Start your project**
    3. Sign in or create an account
    4. Click **New project**
    5. Choose your organization
    6. Enter a **Database Name** (e.g., "ama-whop-app")
    7. Enter a **Database Password** (save this!)
    8. Select a **Region** close to your users
    9. Click **Create new project**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Database Connection Strings">

		alt="How to setup Prisma with Supabase"
	/>
	</Frame>
    <Note>Ensure you replace placeholder `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your saved database password.</Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>



### Step 3: Get Your Whop API Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Whop App">
    1. Go to [https://whop.com/dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard)
    2. Navigate to **Developer**
    3. Click the **Create App** button
    4. Give your app a name (e.g., "AMA Whop App")
    5. Click **Create**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your API Key, Agent User ID, and App ID">
    After creating your app:
    1. Copy the **App API Key** - you'll need this for `WHOP_API_KEY`
    2. Copy the **Agent User ID** - you'll need this for `WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID`
    3. Copy the **App ID** - you'll need this for `WHOP_APP_ID`
    <Note>The Agent User ID allows your app's agent to post messages in the forum (e.g., when an admin answers a question).</Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create local environment file">
    Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env.local`, or create `.env.local` from scratch:
    ```bash
    cp .env.development .env.local
    # OR
    touch .env.local
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Required Variables">
    Open `.env.local` in your text editor and fill in these required fields with the credentials you obtained:
    ```env
    # Database Configuration (Required from Supabase)
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST]:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
    DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/postgres"

    # Whop Integration (Required from Whop Developer Dashboard)
    WHOP_API_KEY=your_whop_api_key_here
    WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID=your_whop_agent_user_id_here
    WHOP_APP_ID=your_whop_app_id_here
	 ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 5: Initialize Database

Run the following commands to set up your database schema with Prisma:
<CodeGroup>
```bash pnpm
pnpm prisma generate
pnpm prisma db push
```
```bash npm
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:db:push
```
```bash yarn
yarn prisma:generate
yarn prisma:db:push
```
</CodeGroup>
<Note>This will apply the schema defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` to your Supabase database.</Note>

>If you want to use the native prisma CLI, you'll need to move your `.env.local` to `.env` and run the commands manually

### Step 6: Start Development Server

<CodeGroup>
```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```
```bash npm
npm run dev
```
```bash yarn
yarn dev
```
</CodeGroup>

Your app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

<Warning>
  Ensure you are viewing the app through the Whop Localhost proxy/iframe setup for correct integration.
  After installing your app to a Whop, navigate to its settings within Whop and switch from "Production" to "Localhost", ensuring the port is 3000.
</Warning>

###  Step 7: Deploy to vercel

Deploy your AMA app to make it accessible to your community members. Vercel is recommended for Next.js applications.


<Steps>
  <Step title="Push to GitHub">
    Ensure all your latest changes are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
    git push origin main
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy on Vercel">
    1. Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
    2. Create a new project and import your app's GitHub repository.
    3. Configure Environment Variables: In your Vercel project settings, add all the variables from your `.env.local` file (DATABASE_URL, DIRECT_URL, WHOP_API_KEY, etc.).
    4. Click **Deploy**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Whop App Settings">
    Once deployed, copy your production URL from Vercel.
    1. Go to your Whop app dashboard â†’ **Developer** â†’ Your App.
    2. In the **Hosting** section, update:
       - **Base URL**: Your Vercel production URL.
       - **App path**: `/experiences/[experienceId]` (or as configured).
    3. Click **Save**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

This section outlines the core mechanics of the AMA app.

### Whop SDK Integration

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Uses `verifyUserToken` from the Whop SDK for secure server-side request validation. Admin-specific actions leverage `checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience` to ensure proper permissions.
- **Forum Management**: Utilizes `findOrCreateForum` for automatically setting up a dedicated forum within the experience if one doesn't exist. New answers trigger `createForumPost` to share the Q&A with the community. Forum permissions can be configured (e.g., `whoCanPost: "admins"`).

### Core Features

- **Anonymous Questions**: Submitted questions are limited to 100 characters. They are stored with `experienceId` but without any user-identifying information to maintain anonymity.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins have a dedicated interface to view pending questions (sorted by newest first), answer them using the input field, or delete inappropriate submissions.
- **Database Schema**: A `Question` model tracks the question, answer, status (`PENDING`/`APPROVED`), associated `experienceId`, `forumPostId` (once answered), and timestamps.


### Customization

Feel free to adapt the app to your specific needs.

- **UI & Styling**: Modify Tailwind CSS styles in `app/globals.css`. Customize or create new React components in the `components/` directory.
- **Functionality**: Adjust character limits for questions in the submission form. Modify forum post templates or content. Extend admin panel capabilities.

Be creative and customize to your liking!

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Database connection fails">
    - Double-check your `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` in your environment variables.
    - Ensure your Supabase project is running and accessible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Whop authentication errors">
    - Confirm your `WHOP_API_KEY`, `WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID`, and `WHOP_APP_ID` are correct in your environment variables and match those in your Whop Developer Dashboard.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Forum creation or posting fails">
    - Verify the `WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID` has the necessary permissions for the target experience (usually admin access).
    - Check for any errors returned by the Whop API in your server logs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="App not loading in Whop iframe (localhost)">
    - Ensure the Whop dev proxy is running if you're using it.
    - In Whop, under your app's settings for the installed experience, ensure you've switched from "Production" to "Localhost" and set the correct port (e.g., 3000).
    - Check your browser's developer console for any errors.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
