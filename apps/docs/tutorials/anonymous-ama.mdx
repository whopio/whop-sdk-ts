Learn how to set up & deploy a full-featured Anonymous Ask Me Anything (AMA) app that integrates seamlessly with the Whop ecosystem. Users can submit anonymous questions and admins can answer them, automatically creating forum posts for community discussion.

**🎮 [Test Live App in your whop](https://whop.com/apps/app_lAgURr4dDAesot/install/)** | **📦 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Yohanan-Negash/ama-whop-app)**

## 🎯 What You'll Build

- 🕵️ **Anonymous Question Submission** - Users can ask questions without revealing their identity
- 👑 **Admin Panel** - Experience admins can view, answer, and manage questions
- 📝 **Forum Integration** - Answered questions become forum posts for community engagement
- 🏠 **Clean UI** - Modern, responsive design with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI
- 🔐 **Whop Authentication** - Seamless integration with Whop's user system
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard** - Stats and content management for admins

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- pnpm installed (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- A Whop developer account
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and Next.js

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ama-whop-app.git
cd ama-whop-app
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

<CodeGroup>
```bash
pnpm install
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Set up Supabase Database

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click **Start your project**
3. Sign in or create an account
4. Click **New project**
5. Choose your organization
6. Enter a **Database Name** (e.g., "ama-whop-app")
7. Enter a **Database Password** (save this!)
8. Select a **Region** close to your users
9. Click **Create new project**

Once your project is created:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Database**
2. Scroll down to **Connection string**
3. Copy the **URI** format for `DATABASE_URL`
4. Copy the **Direct connection** for `DIRECT_URL`

### Step 4: Get Your Whop Credentials

1. Navigate to the [Whop Developer Dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard)
2. Click on Developer Tab
3. Create a new app or select an existing one
4. Go to the "API Keys" section to obtain your `WHOP_API_KEY` and `WHOP_APP_ID`
5. Create an agent user for your app and use their ID for `WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID`

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

```bash
cp .env.development .env.local
```

Open `.env.local` in your text editor and fill in these required fields:

```env
# Database Configuration (Required)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST]:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/postgres"

# Whop Integration (Required)
WHOP_API_KEY="your_whop_app_api_key_here"
WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID="your_bot_user_id_here"
WHOP_APP_ID="your_whop_app_id_here"
```

### Step 6: Initialize Database
<CodeGroup>
```bash
pnpm prisma:generate
pnpm prisma:db:push
```

```bash npm
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:db push
```

```bash yarn
yarn prisma:generate
yarn prisma:db:push
```
</CodeGroup>


This will create the initial migration files and set up your database schema.

### Step 7: Start Development Server

<CodeGroup>
```bash
pnpm dev
```

```bash npm
npm run dev
```

```bash yarn
yarn dev
```
</CodeGroup>


Your app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and follow the directions on the page.

After following the instructions on the page, you'll be able to start developing your app. 

- Created your app
- Set up your `.env.local` file
- Installed your app into your whop

Ensure you're developing in `localhost` mode. See example:

    alt="How to change to localhost mode"
  />
</Frame>

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Whop SDK Integration

**Authentication & Authorization**
- Uses `verifyUserToken` for secure request validation
- Leverages `checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience` for admin verification

**Forum Management**
- Utilizes `findOrCreateForum` for automatic forum setup
- Implements `createForumPost` for question-to-discussion conversion
- Configurable forum permissions (`whoCanPost: "admins"`)

### Core Features

**Anonymous Questions**
- 100 character limit for quality control
- Stored with only experience context (no user identification)
- Real-time validation and feedback

**Admin Panel**
- View pending questions chronologically
- Answer questions with text
- Delete inappropriate content
- Automatic forum post creation

**Database Schema**
- Simple Question model with status tracking (PENDING/APPROVED)
- Timestamps for simple analytics

## 🚀 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your repository
   - Add your environment variables in Settings → Environment Variables
   - Deploy!

### Alternative Platforms
- **Railway** - Full-stack apps with managed PostgreSQL
- **Netlify** - Static deployments with serverless functions

## 🔧 Customization

**UI & Styling**
- Edit colors and styles in `app/globals.css`
- Customize components in `components/` directory
- Update question categories and icons

**Settings**
- Adjust character limits in question form
- Modify forum post templates
- Configure admin panel options

Be creative and customize to your liking!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**
- **Database connection fails** → Check Supabase connection strings
- **Whop auth errors** → Verify API keys in Whop dashboard
- **Forum creation fails** → Ensure agent user has experience permissions
