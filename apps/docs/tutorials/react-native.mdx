title: "React Native (Beta)"
description: Build whop apps using React Native for fast, mobile optimized experiences.
---

<Info>
  The react native sdks are still in beta and we're actively working to improve
  and fix any bugs. Currently the [whop
  courses](https://whop.com/apps/app_0vPZThfBpAwLo/) app is fully powered by
  react native on both iOS and Android.
</Info>

# Getting started

Create a new app in the [dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer) and copy environment variables from the app details page.

### Create the app locally

Ensure you have at least node 22+ installed and pnpm 9.15+.
To check run `node -v` and `pnpm -v`.

```bash
pnpm create @whop/react-native@latest
```

This creates a new whop react native skeleton app. `cd` into your new folder (named after your provided app name) and install dependencies using pnpm.

```bash
cd my-app
pnpm install
```

### Edit your code

The entry point for your app is in `src/views/experience-view.tsx`.
This view will be rendered when a creator installs your app into their whop.

For example, you can render a button that will greet the current user id.

```tsx
import type { ExperienceViewProps } from "@whop/react-native";
import { Button, Alert, View } from "react-native";

export function ExperienceView(props: ExperienceViewProps) {
  function handleGreet() {
    Alert.alert(
      `Hello ${props.currentUserId}! Welcome to experience ${props.experienceId}`
    );
  }

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
      <Button title="Click Me!" onPress={handleGreet} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Install your app

Install your new app into your whop so you can preview it on your phone.

```bash
pnpm whop-react-native install
```

Open the app from inside your whop on your iPhone and shake it.
This enables "dev mode" and allows you to see the latest 'non production' react native builds.
On android you can use the info button in the top right to toggle developer mode.

Right now, it should show an error in the bottom saying "No build found ..."

<Info>
  Developer mode can only be activated by owners and admins of the company that
  owns the app.
</Info>

### Ship it!

```bash
pnpm ship
```

The `ship` command will build and upload your app to the whop servers. You can
limit the platforms by passing either `--ios` or `--android`. From here it
will be pushed live to your phone.

<Info>
  The `ship` command will NOT push the app to existing users of your app. It is
  safe to run on existing web apps too meaning you can progressively migrate
  your app to react native.
</Info>

### Deploy to production.

Once you're happy with your app go to your [developer dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer) and click "Promote to production" on your latest development build.

After going through an automated review, the app will be pushed instantly to all users of your app on iOS and Android.

<Info>
  ProTip: the `pnpm ship` command prints out a link you can use to promote your
  app to production.
</Info>

From the builds screen you can also instant rollback to a previous production build which will be pushed live to all users across whop.

# Native Integration

The beauty of react native is its rich integration with native platform features and APIs.

The Whop app exposes a set of common powerful native building blocks your can directly use in your react native app.

Features like video playback, camera access, native gestures and animations are available already.
We plan on expanding the capabilities to allow many different kinds of apps to be built!

You can use these libraries pinned to these version:

- `react-native-nitro-modules@0.26.3`
- `react-native-video@6.16.1`
- `@d11/react-native-fast-image@8.10.0`
- `react-native-svg@15.12.0`
- `react-native-webview@13.15.0`
- `react-native-reanimated@3.18.0`
- `react-native-gesture-handler@2.27.2`
- `react-native-haptic-feedback@2.3.3`
- `react-native-vision-camera@4.7.1`
- `react-native-safe-area-context@5.5.2`
- `lottie-react-native@7.3.2` _(in next release)_
- `react-native-image-picker@8.2.1` _(in next release)_

# Whop SDK

The whop sdk is available for use in the react native app out of the box. Using this you can fetch data within the scope of the current user.

<Info>
  We recommend using the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query` to fetch
  data.
</Info>

```tsx
import { whopSdk } from "@whop/react-native";

export function MyComponent() {
  const { data: user } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["user"],
    queryFn: () => whopSdk.users.getCurrentUser(),
  });

  return <Text>{user?.name}</Text>;
}
```

# Future plans

- Filesystem access
- Whop UI Kit
- Integrated router + robust deeplinking support
- More native modules
- Web Support + Hosting!
- Anything you might want. [Join the developer community!](https://whop.com/developers)

# Making authenticated requests

You can make authenticated requests to your api by using the same proxy infrastructure used for existing web apps.

1. Set your api origin as the `Base Domain` in the [developer dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer)
2. Make a normal fetch request from your react native app using the `apiOrigin` from `__internal_execSync("getAppApiOrigin", {})`

```tsx
const apiOrigin = __internal_execSync("getAppApiOrigin", {});

// Assuming your server has this api endpoint:
fetch(`${apiOrigin}/api/v1/users/me`).then((res) => res.json());
```

3. On your server use the standard `verifyUserToken` function from the SDK to verify the request. Auth between react native apps and whop iframe apps is exactly the same meaning you can _reuse_ your backend.

# Color themes

React native by default exposes a `useColorScheme` hook that you can use to get the current color scheme of the device. This works correctly out of the box on whop react native apps too!.

While we are still building our UI kit, you can use the following `useColors` hook as inspiration to build your own dynamic color scheme:

```bash
# Install the radix ui colors package
pnpm i @radix-ui/colors
```

```tsx Usage
function MyComponent() {
  const colors = useColors();

  return <View style={{ backgroundColor: colors.gray1 }} />;
}
```

Hook implementation to copy:

```tsx use-colors.ts expandable
import {
  amber,
  amberA,
  amberDark,
  amberDarkA,
  blue,
  blueA,
  blueDark,
  blueDarkA,
  gray,
  grayA,
  grayDark,
  grayDarkA,
  green,
  greenA,
  greenDark,
  greenDarkA,
  red,
  redA,
  redDark,
  redDarkA,
} from "@radix-ui/colors";
import { useColorScheme } from "react-native";

export function useColors() {
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const isDark = colorScheme === "dark";

  // Create all the color groups
  const _grayA = isDark ? grayDarkA : grayA;
  const _gray = isDark ? grayDark : gray;
  const _blueA = isDark ? blueDarkA : blueA;
  const _blue = isDark ? blueDark : blue;
  const _redA = isDark ? redDarkA : redA;
  const _red = isDark ? redDark : red;
  const _amberA = isDark ? amberDarkA : amberA;
  const _amber = isDark ? amberDark : amber;
  const _greenA = isDark ? greenDarkA : greenA;
  const _green = isDark ? greenDark : green;

  // Merge them
  return {
    transparent: "transparent" as const,
    ..._grayA,
    ..._gray,
    ..._blueA,
    ..._blue,
    ..._redA,
    ..._red,
    ..._amberA,
    ..._amber,
    ..._greenA,
    ..._green,
  };
}
```

# Secret internal features

We are still working on polishing our api's but if you wanna build something cool RIGHT NOW, you can use some internal api's to communicate with the whop app.

<Warning>
  These function may throw. Use within a `try {} catch (e) {}` block.
</Warning>

```tsx
import { __internal_execSync, __internal_execAsync } from "@whop/react-native";

// Example usage:
__internal_execSync("routerPush", {
  path: ["some", "second", "page"],
  params: { query: "hello" },
});
// Pro tip: the `path` and `query` is passed as a prop to the `ExperienceView`
// component. This is how multi level routing works for courses currently.

// Full list of calls and types available here:

export interface PathParams {
  path: string[];
  params: Record<string, string>;
}

export interface ExecSyncApi {
  getAppApiOrigin(params: EmptyObject): { apiOrigin: string };
  cacheGet(params: { key?: string | null }): { data?: string | null };
  cacheSet(params: { key?: string | null; data?: string | null }): EmptyObject;
  routerPush(params: PathParams): EmptyObject;
  routerPop(params: EmptyObject): EmptyObject;
  routerGetCurrent(params: EmptyObject): PathParams;
  setNavigationBarData(params: {
    title?: string | null;
    description?: string | null;
  }): EmptyObject;
  routerPresentSheet(params: PathParams): EmptyObject;
  routerDismissSheet(params: EmptyObject): EmptyObject;
  routerGetCurrentSheet(params: EmptyObject): PathParams | null | undefined;
  downgradeToWebView(params: EmptyObject): EmptyObject;
  getHostAppDetails(params: EmptyObject): {
    build: string;
    version: string;
    platform: "ios" | "android" | "web";
    buildType: "appstore" | "testflight" | "debug";
  };
}

export interface ExecAsyncApi extends ExecSyncApi {
  inAppPurchase(params: { id?: string | null; planId: string }): {
    sessionId: string;
    receiptId: string;
  };
}
```
