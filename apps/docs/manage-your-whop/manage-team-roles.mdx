Your Team tab is where you decide who gets access to your whop and what permissions they have. 

Here's how to invite team members, assign the right roles, and manage permissions to keep your whop running smoothly and securely.

## Roles and permissions overview

When you create a whop, there are four different roles you can assign to your team members:

- **Moderator**
- **Sales Manager**
- **Admin**
- **Owner**

Think of these like levels - Moderator has the least access, and Owner has the most.

As the creator of your whop, you'll automatically be assigned the Owner role with all permissions enabled by default.

<Tip>
  If you add another member as an Owner, you can transfer the ownership of the whop to them by:

  1. Going to Dashboard \> Team
  2. Clicking the 3 dots (︙) next to their profile
  3. Selecting Transfer ownership
</Tip>


### The four team roles

**Moderator**

- Delete messages and mute/ban members in the Chat app
- Delete comments in Forums
- Keep your community chat friendly and spam-free

<Tip>
  The Moderator role is best for community managers, support agents, or anyone helping manage your community.
</Tip>

**Sales Manager**

All Moderator permissions, plus:

- View the Users table (but can't export it)
- View and create checkout links

<Tip>
  The Sales Manager role is best for marketing team members, affiliate managers, or sales reps who need to create and track custom checkout links.
</Tip>

**Admin**

All Moderator and Sales Manager permissions, plus:

- View waitlists and cancellation reasons
- Access Finances section (except Payouts)
- View Marketing section
- Invite other team members (Moderators and Sales Managers only)
- View general settings (but can't edit them)

<Tip>
  The Admin role is best for operations managers, team leads, heads of marketing/community, or anyone needing broader dashboard access.
</Tip>

**Owner**

All permissions from other roles, plus:

- Access to Payouts
- View and manage API keys, OAuth, and Webhooks settings
- Edit the store page
- Invite new Owners
- Full control over all whop settings

<Tip>
  The Owner role is best for founders, co-founders, CTOs, or finance/legal leads who need complete control.

<Warning>
  Important: Some things your team can do (like deleting messages or checkout links) can't be undone and could hurt your business. Always give people the lowest level of access they need to do their job.

## How to add team members to your whop

Adding team members is quick and easy, but make sure you set things up securely first.

Here's how:

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Team**
2. **(Recommended):** Toggle on **Require 2FA** to make sure all team members use secure login
3. Click **Invite team member** in the top right corner
4. Enter the person's email address in the **Email** field
5. Select their role from the **Role** dropdown menu
6. Click **Invite**

They'll get an invitation email automatically. When they accept, they'll show up in your team table with their new permissions.

You can see all your pending invites on the **Invites** tab next to **Members**.

<Warning>
  Start small. Always give someone the lowest role that lets them do their job. You can always give them more access later, but you can't undo mistakes or get back deleted stuff.
</Warning>


## How to change team member roles

You can update anyone's role at any time to give them more or less access.

To change someone's role:

1. Go to **Dashboard \> Team**
2. Find the team member in the members table
3. Click the dropdown menu in their **Role** column
4. Select their new role
5. Click **Save**

The change happens right away, and they'll have their new permissions immediately.

## How to remove team members

If you need to remove someone from your team, you can do it quickly, and they'll lose access right away.

To remove a team member:

1. Go to **Dashboard \> Team**
2. Find the team member you want to remove
3. Click the three dots (︙) on the right side of their row
4. Select **Remove user**
5. Click the red **Remove user** button in the confirmation pop-up

They'll immediately lose access to your whop and will need to be reinvited if you want to add them back later.
