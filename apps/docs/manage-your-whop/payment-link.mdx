Checkout links let you send customers straight to a payment page to buy your products or services. You can offer free access, one-time payments, or monthly subscriptions.

Use checkout links to collect payments, send invoices, or add payment links to your own website.

## Where can I find and create my checkout links?

You can create and manage checkout links from two places:

### Your Dashboard (_Checkout links_)

- Go to your **Dashboard** \> **Checkout links** to see all your links
- Click **\+ Create checkout link** to create a new one

### Your whop's Pricing page (_Pricing options_)

- Go to your whop \> **Manage pricing** to see all your pricing options
- Click the link symbol (next to the 3 dots) to copy your link
- Click **\+ Create pricing option** at the bottom right

<Tip>
  Every pricing option you create on your whop can be found at Dashboard \> Checkout links.

  And every checkout link you create on your dashboard can be found at whop \> Manage pricing.
</Tip>

## How to create a checkout link

You can create three types of checkout links:

- **Free links** - Give customers free access to your whop
- **One-time payment links** - Charge customers once
- **Recurring payment links** - Set up monthly or yearly subscriptions

<Tip>
  Each checkout link is connected to one of your whops. When you create the link from your whop's pricing page, it's automatically connected to that whop. When you create it from your Dashboard, you'll need to choose which whop it's for.
