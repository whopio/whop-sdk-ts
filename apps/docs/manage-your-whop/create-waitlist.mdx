A waitlist allows you to control who joins your whop. People apply to join, you review them, then approve the ones you want.

<Tip>
  You can view and manage all your waitlist entries by going to your Dashboard \> Waitlists.

## How to create a waitlist checkout option

**To set up a waitlist for your whop:**

1. Go to your **Dashboard** \> **Checkout links**
2. Click **\+ Create checkout link**
3. Toggle **Advanced options** and click **Add a waitlist**
4. Click **Create**

That's it\! Anyone who joins through your checkout link will now be added to the waitlist instead of getting immediate access.

## How to add questions to your waitlist

Pro tip: Add required questions for customers to answer before joining your waitlist. This will help qualify potential members and assess if they’re a good fit for your whop.

To add questions to your waitlist:

- Go to **Dashboard** \> **Checkout links**
- Find your waitlist link and click the 3 dots (⋮)
- Click **Edit**
- Under **Advanced options**, click **Ask questions before checkout**
- Add your question titles and placeholder text
- Click **Save**

## How to approve/deny waitlist entries

Go to **Dashboard \> Waitlists** to manage your waitlist. From here, you can:

- **Approve** (thumbs up button) or **deny** (thumbs down button) individual users
- **Admit all entries** at once by clicking the **\+ Admit all entries** button
- **Export entries** by clicking the **Export** button in the top right
- **Contact users** on your waitlist via DM or email

When you approve someone, they'll automatically get access to your whop and receive a notification.

## When to use a waitlist

Waitlists work great when you want to:

- **Build anticipation while you're still creating**: Collect emails, build an audience, and validate demand without opening access right away.
- **Qualify potential customers**: Add custom questions to qualify leads before giving them access.
- **Create exclusivity for your community**: When people have to apply and wait for approval, it makes your whop feel more valuable and desirable. 
- **Launch a limited beta** — Control who gets early access by reviewing applicants before letting them in. Perfect for testing with a smaller, high-quality group.
