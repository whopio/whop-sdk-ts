You can set up automated messages on Whop to send personalized DMs and emails when:

1. Someone joins your whop;
2. Someone leaves your whop; and
3. Someone checks out your store page but doesn't buy.

## How to find the automated messages settings

1. **Open your Dashboard**: From your Whop account, click **Dashboard** on the left side of your screen to access your whop's advanced settings.
2. **Find Automated messages**: Under the **Marketing** section in your sidebar, click **Automated messages**.

Here, you'll see three automated message options: User joined, User left, and New lead.

## How to set up 'User joined' messages
