Free trials are one of the most powerful tools for growing your whop - they let people try before they buy, which means more customers and better conversion rates.

Here’s how to set up and optimize your free trial strategy in just a few minutes.

## Why offer a free trial?

Here's why they work so well:

- **Higher conversion rates**: Data shows that 30-day free trials get a 56% conversion rate. When people have time to see your full value, they're much more likely to stick around and pay.
- **No cost to you**: Offering digital access through Whop costs you nothing. You only pay Whop's fee when someone actually buys, so free trials are totally risk-free.
- **Reduce the risk for your customers**: Lots of people don't want to pay upfront for something they haven't tried. Free trials remove that worry and let your product do the talking.

## How to set up a free trial for you whop

You can set up a free trial in two ways - choose whichever is easier for you:

<Note>
  You can only add a free trial to 'Recurring' checkout links.

### Through your Dashboard

To set up a free trial from your Dashboard:

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Checkout links**
2. Pick an existing link and click the 3 dots (⋮) \> **Edit**, or make a new one by clicking **\+ Create checkout link**
3. Check **Free trial**
4. Pick how many free days you want to offer (like 1 day, 7 days, or 30 days)
5. Click **Update checkout link** to activate your free trial

### Through your whop's Pricing page

To set up a free trial from your whop's **Pricing** page:

1. Go to **whop** \> **Manage pricing**
2. Pick an existing pricing option and click the 3 dots (…) \> **Edit**, or make a new one by clicking **\+ Create pricing option**
3. Check **Free trial**
4. Pick how many free days you want to offer 
5. Click **Update checkout link** to activate your free trial

<Warning>
  After the trial ends, people automatically get charged the full price unless they cancel first. This helps you make more money without doing any extra work.
</Warning>


## Understanding trial abuse and prevention

While free trials are powerful, a small minority of customers may try to abuse the system. Here's what you need to know:

- **What is trial abuse? **This happens when someone keeps signing up for free trials but cancels before they have to pay. They might use different emails or make new accounts to avoid paying.
- **How Whop stops this:** Whop automatically catches when the same person tries to sign up for multiple free trials. If someone cancels and then tries to rejoin with another trial, the system will charge them full price instead of giving them another free period.

<Tip>
  Don't worry too much about this - 99% of people use trials honestly, and Whop handles the bad actors automatically.

## When to use free trials

Free trials work best for specific business models and communities. Here's when to consider offering them:

### Perfect for free trials:

- **Communities**: People need time to join conversations, make friends, and see what the community is really like.
- **Courses and educational content**: Students need time to go through lessons, do assignments, and see real progress.
- **Tools and software**: People need time to learn the tool, fit it into their workflow, and see how it helps them.
- **Newsletters and ongoing content**: Subscribers need time to see the consistent value you deliver week after week.
- **Template libraries**: People need time to browse through everything and find what's most useful for them.

### Skip free trials when:

- Your product gives instant value (like a single ebook or template)
- Your product costs less than \$10 (trials might be more work than they're worth)
- You offer one-on-one calls or services that can't really be "trialed"

<Tip>
  Not sure if trials are right for you? Try running a 7 or 30 day trial for one month and see how your conversion rates compare to normal signups. The numbers will tell you if it's working.
