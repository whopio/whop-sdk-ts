## International payouts

Creators outside the US need to set up a bank account that accepts the currency of their registered country.

On Whop Payments, Whop is the _Merchant of Record_, and our system automatically converts all currencies to the currency of the geography you initially chose when you set up your Whop organization:

- This means that, even if you accept payments in USD, Whop automatically converts the USD payments to your local currency before sending payouts.
- Payouts will NOT successfully go through to a USD-accepting bank account if the bank account is located in a country where USD is not the local currency.

<Warning>
  Your payout country can't be changed for an existing whop. To switch countries, create a new whop and set up Whop Payments under the new country with an associated bank account.
</Warning>


## PayPal payouts

To receive PayPal payouts, customers must buy using PayPal (no post-purchase transfer to PayPal).

### Setting up payouts to your PayPal

1. Go to your **Dashboard** \> **Payouts** \> **Additional payment methods**.
2. Select **Setup** next to the **PayPal** option.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to link your PayPal account.

<Tip>
  For PayPal to appear at checkout, check the PayPal box under Payment options when you create a checkout link.

## Coinbase payouts

**Important notes:**

- Withdrawals must go to a Coinbase wallet
- To receive Coinbase payouts, customers must buy using crypto (no post-purchase transfer to Coinbase)

### Setting up payouts to your Coinbase crypto wallet

1. Go to your **Dashboard** \> **Payouts** \> **Additional payment methods**.
2. Select **Setup** next to the **Coinbase** option.

  To get paid with crypto, you have to set up a one-time pricing plan.

## Troubleshooting payouts

### Common payout statuses

- **Requested:** A withdrawal has been initiated and is awaiting approval
- **Processing / In Transit:** Payment is processing (takes 1–5 business days)
- **Completed:** Funds sent by Whop, awaiting bank processing

### Payout timing & processing delays

**Standard timing:**

- When you make a sale, the money will be available for withdrawal in 1–4 business days
- Once withdrawn, allow up to 10 business days for the payout to be processed and arrive in your bank

**If a payout fails: **

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Payouts**.
2. Click **Retry payout** next to the failed transaction.

You can also click on the payout to see more information on the payout timeline and why the payout may have failed.

**Common reasons for failed payouts:**

- Your bank account is not in the local currency of the country where you registered your Whop
- You entered your bank account information incorrectly

**To replace your bank account:**

- Go to your **Dashboard** \> **Payouts**.
- Click on **Withdraw**.
- Click on your bank account (under the amount you want to withdraw).
- Input your new bank account details and click **Replace** (bottom right).

### If a payout says "Completed" but money hasn't arrived

This means the payout has been processed on Whop's end.

1. Allow up to 5 business days (excluding weekends and bank holidays) for your bank to process it.
2. If it takes longer, click on the payout to see the payout timeline. A Trace ID will be provided.

**To track or trace your payout:**

1. Contact your bank's customer service.
2. Share the Trace ID, payout date, amount, and payor name (Whop).

## Affiliate payouts

There is a 30-day waiting period from when the referred customer made their purchase and when the referrer gets paid the affiliate cut. This waiting period is to protect businesses on Whop from potential disputes and refunds.

**To withdraw your affiliate earnings:**

1. Go to your **Profile** \> **Balance**.
2. Click on **Withdraw**.
3. Input the **Amount** you want to withdraw and click on **Confirm withdrawal**.
