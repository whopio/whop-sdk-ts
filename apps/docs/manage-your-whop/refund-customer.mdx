## How to process a refund

There are three ways to refund a customer: through their **profile** (quickest method), **Payments**, or the **Resolution Center**.

    This is the fastest way if you know the customer's name:

    1. Go to your **Dashboard**
    2. Use the search bar at the top right to find the customer
    3. Click on their profile
    4. Click the **Refund** button under **Spend**
       - Or scroll down to **Payments** and click **Refund** next to the specific payment
    5. Choose your refund amount:
       - Click **Refund** for the full amount
       - Check **Partial refund** and enter the amount you want to refund
    6. Click **Confirm**

## Set up auto-refunds to save time

If you want to automatically handle smaller refund requests, you can set up auto-refunds for amounts under a certain threshold.

To set up auto-refunds:

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Resolution Center**
2. Click **Auto respond**
3. Set your auto-refund thresholds:
   - **Auto-refund card payments below**: Set the maximum amount for automatic card refunds
   - **Auto-refund PayPal payments below**: Set the maximum amount for automatic PayPal refunds
4. Add a custom message (optional) that customers will see when they receive an auto-refund
5. Click **Save**

## What to do if you don't have enough balance

If your Whop account doesn't have sufficient funds for a refund, you'll need to add money to your account first.

### Top up your balance

To add funds to your account:

1. Go to **Dashboard \> Payouts**
2. Click **Top up \+**
3. Enter the amount you want to add
4. Choose to pay from your personal balance or select another payment method
5. Click **Pay**

<Tip>
  Always keep some money in your account so you can process refunds quickly. This keeps customers happy and makes your business look professional.
</Tip>

### Set up minimum balance retention

If you use **Recurring withdrawals**, you can automatically keep money in your account for refunds:

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Payouts**
2. Click **Recurring withdrawals**
3. Set your withdrawal schedule (**Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Monthly**) and click **Continue**
4. Enter the minimum amount you want to keep in your account and click **Continue**
   - We recommend keeping enough to cover at least two refunds at your typical price
5. Click **Confirm**

<Tip>
  If you only use manual withdrawals, you can't set a minimum balance to retain — you'll need to manage your balance manually.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do fees work with refunds?">
    When you refund someone, you pay back the full amount they originally paid — even though you received less after fees were deducted.

    For example: If a customer paid \$100, you'll refund the full \$100 even though you only received around \$97 after Whop and processing fees.

    This applies to both full and partial refunds. There are no additional fees to process a refund.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long does it take for customers to receive their refunds?">
    It depends on the customer's bank or payment method. Customers can typically expect to see refunds in their account within 3-7 business days after the refund is processed.
