You can control who gets access to your best stuff by creating locked content. Members either need to pay extra or get special permission to unlock it.

This is a great way to make more money from your community — you can offer premium upgrades, exclusive content, or special member perks.

## Understanding locked content

Locked content on Whop allows you to restrict access to specific apps. Only some people can get in - either by paying or getting permission from you.

This helps you make more money and keep members engaged by offering:

- **Premium features**: Offer more features for an extra fee
  - Example: Give everyone your daily picks, but charge extra for a bankroll management guide
- **Exclusive content**: Special access for certain members only
  - Example: Include your course for everyone, but lock templates behind a paywall
- **Upselling opportunities**: Show more products during or after checkout
  - Example: Someone buys your crypto course? Offer them your forex course too.

Your apps can be set to:

- **Draft**: Hidden from all members
- **Visible**: Accessible for everyone in your community
- **Locked**: Restricted access with payment or permission required

<Tip>
  Locked and premium content work the same way. Both are set up using Locked apps — but locked content is Free, and premium content is Paid (one-time).
</Tip>

## Create locked content

To set up locked content in your whop, you need to choose the specific app you would like to lock:

1. Click the 3 dots (⋮) next to the app you want to lock and click **App settings**
2. Under **Visibility**, choose **Locked**
3. Pick either **Free** or **Paid (one-time)** access

## Set pricing and access options

### Free locked content

Choose **Free** and **Add a waitlist** to control who gets in. Free locked content works great for:

- Special content for your best members
- Testing new features with a small group
- Rewarding your most active community members

### Paid locked content

Choose **Paid (one-time)** to make money from your locked content. You'll set:

- The price
- What currency you want to use
- The upsell method ([see more details below](#choose-your-upsell-method))

### Additional settings

There are some bonus features you can turn on:

- **Expiration:** Set when access runs out. Great for limited-time offers or making people buy access again later
- **iOS screenshot protection:** Stop people from taking screenshots to prevent leaks
- **Add to other whops:** Use the same locked app in multiple whops you own

## Choose your upsell method

When creating paid locked content, you need to decide when and where members will see your offer. The timing can make a big difference in how many people buy.

You have three upsell methods to choose from:

### 1. Before checkout

Shows up as an add-on on the checkout page of your whop (i.e. an order bump). Your prospective customer will have the option to add it to their cart and pay extra to access the locked content.

This is perfect for related products or upgrades and helps you make more money per sale.

### 2. After checkout

A popup appears right after someone joins your whop (i.e. an upsell). This is great for showing premium content to people who have just joined your whop (when they already have their wallet out and are in the buying mood).

You have two options to set up your custom upsell page:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Option 1">
    - Find the Locked app and click the **3 dots (⋮)** next to the app
    - Click **App settings**
    - Click the edit link under **After checkout**
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Option 2">
    1. Click **Edit store page** \> **Edit details**
    2. Scroll and click **Upsells**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

From there, you can add:

- **Upsell title**: Write something that grabs attention
- **Upsell description**: Explain why it's worth it (180 characters max)
- **Upload video**: Add a video explaining your offer (16:9 works best)
- Click **Save** when you're done.

<Tip>
  Pro tip: Record a short video of yourself talking about the premium content. It builds trust and way more people will buy compared to just having text.
</Tip>

### 3. Only display in this whop

Locked content will show as Locked inside your whop. Members can find and buy it while organically browsing inside your whop.
