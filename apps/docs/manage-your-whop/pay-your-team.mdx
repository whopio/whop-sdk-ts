When you send it, your team member gets an email and a DM notification. They can then go to **Profile** \> **Balance** to cash out.

**Here's how to do it**:

1. Click the user's profile picture
   - If you know their username, you can also go to their profile by searching: **whop.com/@usernameÂ **
2. On their profile, click the **Pay **button next to **Message**.
3. Fill out the payment details:
   - **Enter amount:** Type how much you want to send
   - **Write a note:** Add a note (optional)
   - Select the **Balance** you'll send the payment from

Click **Send** to send the money.

They'll get the same email and message notification, and can cash out through **Profile \> Balance**.
