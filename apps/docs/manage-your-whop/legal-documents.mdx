Adding legal documents to your Whop helps cut down on fake disputes and chargebacks. And, your customers will know exactly what to expect when they buy from you.

When someone buys access to your Whop, they automatically agree to Whop's terms. But you can add your own legal documents for more protection.

## What legal documents you can upload

You can upload 4 different legal documents to your Whop:

- **Terms of Service**: Your business terms and conditions
- **Privacy Policy**: How you handle customer data
- **Return Policy**: Your refund and return procedures
- **EULA (End User License Agreement)**: Software or digital product usage terms

<Tip>
  Set up your legal documents before you sell anything. This way, you're protected from day one, and your customers know what they're signing up for.
