Popup promotions show a discount offer to people who've been browsing your store page for 45\+ seconds or are about to click away. Even if they don't purchase immediately, you capture their contact info so you can follow up later.

## Enable popup promotions

  <Step title="Access your store settings" titleSize="h3">
    Go to your **Dashboard** and click **Edit store page** under the Admin area of your whop, then click the **Edit details** button on the store page.

## Set up your popup promotion

When you enable popup promotions, you'll need to configure the settings:

- **Set your discount percentage**: Use the **Discount percentage** field to decide how much of a deal you want to offer. This is what visitors will see when they've been browsing for 45\+ seconds or are trying to leave your store page (showing exit intent).

## View and contact your leads

When popup promotions are running, you can view your leads and follow up with them directly.
