## Native Integration

The beauty of react native is its rich integration with native platform features and APIs.

The Whop app exposes a set of common powerful native building blocks your can directly use in your react native app.

Features like video playback, camera access, native gestures and animations are available already on mobile platforms.
Web support provides access to browser APIs and web-specific features.
We plan on expanding the capabilities to allow many different kinds of apps to be built!
