## System requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
- [pnpm 9.15](https://pnpm.io/) or later.

To check run `node -v` and `pnpm -v`.

## Create your app

The easiest way to create a new Whop React Native app is by using `create @whop/react-native`, which will set up a new project for you.

```bash
pnpm create @whop/react-native@latest
```

## Preview your app

To preview your app you will need to deploy a [development build](/apps/react-native/deploying#deploy-a-development-build) and install your app into your whop.

<Note>
  Every time you want to preview new changes, you will need to deploy a new development build.
</Note>

### 1. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and fill in your values:

```
WHOP_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID=your_agent_user_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID=your_company_id
```

Get these credentials from the [Whop Developer Dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer):
1. Go to the Whop Developer Dashboard
2. Create a new app or select an existing one
3. Copy the environment variables from the app settings

### 2. Deploy a development build 

Use the `ship` command to build and upload a development build of your app:

```bash
pnpm ship
```

<Info>
  The `ship` command will NOT push the app to existing users of your app. It is
  safe to run on existing web apps too meaning you can progressively migrate
  your app to react native.
</Info>

See the [Deploying](/apps/react-native/deploying) page for more information.

### 3. Preview on your phone

Use the `preview` command to install your app into your whop and preview it on your phone:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

<Warning>
  To preview your app, you must **SHAKE YOUR PHONE**. This enables "dev mode" and allows you to see the latest 'non production' react native builds.
</Warning>

See the [Troubleshooting](/apps/react-native/troubleshooting) page if you're having issues.
