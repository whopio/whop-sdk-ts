    companyId: "biz_***",
    companyMemberId: "mber_***",

  // ^? null

  // With member:basic:read
  // ^? { user: { id: "user_***", email: null, ... }, ... }

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many permissions can I request?">
    You can request as many permissions as you want.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I request additional permissions afterwards?">
    Yes. You can request additional permissions and the creator will be asked to re-approve them.
    <Note>
      Keep in mind that until the permissions are re-approved, API requests requiring the **newly requested** permissions will fail. Make sure to handle these errors gracefully in your code.
