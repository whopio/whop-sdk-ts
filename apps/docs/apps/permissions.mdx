## Configure your permissions

You can update your currently granted permissions or re-approve them in your [Authorized apps](https://whop.com/dashboard/settings/authorized-apps) settings.

To manually navigate to the settings, go to: `Dashboard -> Settings -> Authorized apps`

## Configure your SDK

Update your `SDK` configuration by removing the `onBehalfOfUserId` and `companyId` properties.

```js lib/whop-sdk.ts
import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

export const whopSdk = WhopServerSdk({
	// Add your app id here - this is required.
	// You can get this from the Whop dashboard after creating an app section.
	appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID ?? "fallback",

	// Add your app api key here - this is required.
	// You can get this from the Whop dashboard after creating an app section.
	appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY ?? "fallback",

	// This will make api requests on behalf of this user. // [!code --:5]
	// This is optional, however most api requests need to be made on behalf of a user.
	// You can create an agent user for your app, and use their userId here.
	// You can also apply a different userId later with the `withUser` function.
	onBehalfOfUserId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID,

	// This is the companyId that will be used for the api requests. // [!code --:5]
	// When making api requests that query or mutate data about a company, you need to specify the companyId.
	// This is optional, however if not specified certain requests will fail.
	// This can also be applied later with the `withCompany` function.
	companyId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID,
});
```

## Examples

### Get a member's email address

```ts
  const member = await whopSdk.companies.getMember({
    companyId: "biz_***",
    companyMemberId: "mber_***",
  });

  // Without member:basic:read
  // ^? null

  // With member:basic:read
  // ^? { user: { id: "user_***", email: null, ... }, ... }

  // With member:basic:read & member:email:read
  // ^? { user: { id: "user_***", email: "***@gmail.com", ... }, ... }
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many permissions can I request?">
    You can request as many permissions as you want.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I know which permissions I need?">
    You can find the required permissions for each SDK method documented in the [SDK reference](/sdk/installation).
	 <Frame>
		![SDK Reference Permissions](/images/sdk-reference-required-permissions.png)
	 </Frame>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I request additional permissions afterwards?">
    Yes. You can request additional permissions and the creator will be asked to re-approve them.

    <Note>
      Keep in mind that until the permissions are re-approved, API requests requiring the **newly requested** permissions will fail. Make sure to handle these errors gracefully in your code.
    </Note>

	 <Warning>
		When developing your app, make sure you re-approve the permissions yourself in your [Authorized apps](https://whop.com/dashboard/settings/authorized-apps) settings.
		
		See [Configure your permissions](/apps/permissions#configure-your-permissions) for more information.
