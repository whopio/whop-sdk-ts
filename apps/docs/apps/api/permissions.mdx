title: Permissions
description: Configure the permissions that your app needs
---

To retrieve private data and perform actions on behalf of companies, your app needs to be installed on the company.

A creator can install your app by finding it in the app store, or by visiting your "direct install" link
which looks like: `https://whop.com/apps/app_xxxxxxxxx` (where `app_xxxxxxxxx` is the id of your app).

Your app can only make calls if it has the required permissions for the api call.
Every endpoint documents it's required permissions in the api reference.

<Note>
  We are working on a full OAuth based permission mode that will allow apps to
  request permissions from users directly and operate on their behalf.
</Note>

## Request permissions

<Warning>
  The permissions flow is still required even if you are trying to access data
  on your own company. This will ensure your app works the same on your company
  as well as when it is installed by others.
</Warning>

<Steps>
	<Step title="Go to your app's permissions settings">
		1. Go to the [developer dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer)
		2. Select or create an app
		3. Click on the **Permissions** tab

    	</Frame>

    </Step>

    <Step title="Add permissions">
    1. Click on **Add permissions** 2. Select the permissions you want to add 3.
    Confirm by clicking **Add**
    </Step>

  <Step title="Configure each permission">
	 1. Write a short explanation for why your app needs the permission
	 2. Choose whether the permission is required or optional. Creators will be able to toggle off optional permissions during install.

  <Step title="Install your app">
	1. Visit your app's direct install link: `https://whop.com/apps/app_xxxxxxxxx/install` (where `app_xxxxxxxxx` is the id of your app).
	2. Select your company you want to install the app on
	3. Approve the permissions you requested
  </Step>
</Steps>

Creators will now need to approve the permissions you requested before installing your app:

## Updating your permissions

You can update your requested permissions anytime. Creators will see a "Re-approve" button when they visit your app.

Creators can always update their granted permissions and re-approve new permissions in their [Authorized apps](https://whop.com/dashboard/settings/authorized-apps) settings page.

To manually navigate to the settings, go to: `Dashboard -> Settings -> Authorized apps`

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>

  [SDK reference](/sdk/installation).
  <Frame>
    ![SDK Reference Permissions](/images/sdk-reference-required-permissions.png)
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I request additional permissions afterwards?">
    Yes. You can request additional permissions and the creator will be asked to re-approve them.

    <Note>
      Keep in mind that until the permissions are re-approved, API requests requiring the **newly requested** permissions will fail. Make sure to handle these errors gracefully in your code.
    </Note>

     <Warning>
    	When developing your app, make sure you re-approve the permissions yourself in your [Authorized apps](https://whop.com/dashboard/settings/authorized-apps) settings.

    	See [Configure your permissions](/apps/permissions#configure-your-permissions) for more information.
