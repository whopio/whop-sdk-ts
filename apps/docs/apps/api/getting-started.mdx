description: Create an app and get your API keys

## Getting your API key

1. Go to [your developer dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer).

2. Click the **Create app** button and give your app a name. _You can change this name later._

3. Your API key is the hidden text after `WHOP_API_KEY` in the `Environment variables` section.

   Use the reveal button to show the key, copy it and keep it in a safe place.

   You will need it to make API calls.

## Making API calls

Our public api is available at `https://api.whop.com/api/v1`

You can test the api by using curl to fetch your public user profile data:

```bash
# replace "j" with your own whop username
curl https://api.whop.com/api/v1/users/j
```

To make authenticated requests you need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme:

```bash
# replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your real API key
curl https://api.whop.com/api/v1/payments/pay_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Using an SDK

We recommending using our SDKs to make API calls in your apps. We currently support

- [Typescript / Javascript](https://npmjs.com/package/@whop/sdk) / [Docs](https://github.com/whopio/whopsdk-typescript)

  ```bash
  pnpm install @whop/sdk
  ```

- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/whop-sdk) / [Docs](https://github.com/whopio/whopsdk-python)

  ```bash
  pip install whop-sdk
  ```

- [Ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/whop-sdk) / [Docs](https://github.com/whopio/whopsdk-ruby)

  ```bash
  gem install whop-sdk
  ```

## Example usage

<Note>
  Make sure you app has the required permissions to make api calls. See
  [Permissions](/apps/api/permissions) for more information.

```typescript Typescript
import Whop from "@whop/sdk";

const client = new Whop({
  appID: "app_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  apiKey: process.env["WHOP_API_KEY"], // This is the default and can be omitted
});

const page = await client.payments.list({ company_id: "biz_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx" });
const paymentListResponse = page.data[0];

console.log(paymentListResponse.id);
```

```python Python
import os
from whop_sdk import Whop

client = Whop(
    app_id="app_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    api_key=os.environ.get("WHOP_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
)

page = client.payments.list(
    company_id="biz_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
)
print(page.data)
```

```ruby Ruby
require "bundler/setup"
require "whop_sdk"

whop = WhopSDK::Client.new(
  api_key: ENV["WHOP_API_KEY"], # This is the default and can be omitted
  app_id: "app_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
)

page = whop.payments.list(company_id: "biz_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx")

puts(page.id)
```
