title: Experience View

The experience view is what users see when they install your app into their Whop and click into it. This is the core functionality of your app - where users interact with your features and services.

    - `[experienceId]` is used to provide the accessed experience ID: `/experiences/[experienceId] -> /experiences/exp_***`
    - `[restPath]` is used for deep linking to specific sections of your app: `/experiences/[experienceId]/[restPath] -> /experiences/exp_***/posts/1`

## Validate access

Check if a user has access to an experience by using the SDK method [checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience](/sdk/api/access/check-if-user-has-access-to-experience).

```ts
  const access = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
    experienceId: "exp_***",
    userId: "user_***",
  });

  // No access
  // ^? { hasAccess: false, accessLevel: "no_access" }

  // Customer access
  // ^? { hasAccess: true, accessLevel: "customer" }

  // Admin access
  // ^? { hasAccess: true, accessLevel: "admin" }
```

See [Validate experience access](/sdk/validate-access#validate-experience-access) for more information.
