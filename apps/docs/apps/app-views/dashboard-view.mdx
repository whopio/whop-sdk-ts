## Validate access

You can check if a user is an authorized member of a company by using the SDK method [checkIfUserHasAccessToCompany](/sdk/api/access/check-if-user-has-access-to-company).

```ts
  const access = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToCompany({
    companyId: "biz_***",
    userId: "user_***",
  });

  // No access
  // ^? { hasAccess: false, accessLevel: "no_access" }

  // Admin access
  // ^? { hasAccess: true, accessLevel: "admin" }
```

See [Validate company access](/sdk/validate-access#validate-company-access) for more information.
