## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn how to do the following tasks:

- Create a page that is shown through the Whop iFrame
- Receive data from Whop using **path parameters**
- Authenticate a user
- Use the Whop API to pull a user's roles

## 1. Create your seller page

We will start by building the **seller page.**

The **seller page** is a specific page URL your app defines. Every time a company views your app from within the Whop Dashboard, they will view the **seller** page within the iFrame.

1. Create a page to match this URL `/seller/$companyId/$experienceId`. To do this, create this file: `/app/seller/[companyId]/[experienceId]/page.tsx`

```bash
mkdir app/seller && mkdir "app/seller/[companyId]" && mkdir "app/seller/[companyId]/[experienceId]" && touch "app/seller/[companyId]/[experienceId]/page.tsx"
```

To know which company is viewing the page, Whop will pass the ID as a **path parameter**. These are defined in the URL on the app settings page, which we will do later.

These are all the options that you can use in the Seller Path, but for now, we will only use `companyId` and `experienceId`:

| Parameter      | Description              |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `companyId`    | The ID of the company    |
| `experienceId` | The ID of the experience |

2. Add the following code to your file to read and display the company ID and experience ID

```javascript
export default async function SellerPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { companyId: string, experienceId: string, },
}) {
  const companyId = params.companyId;
  const experienceId = params.experienceId;
  return (
    <div>
      <p>The company ID is: {companyId}</p>
      <p>The experience ID is: {experienceId}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

3. Update the Seller Path in your [app configuration](https://whop.com/apps) to be `/seller/$companyId/$experienceId`

## 2. Authenticate the user

Once the user is viewing your page, we will want to make sure they are a valid Whop user with permission to view this company. Let's begin.

1. Add two imports to the top of your page

```javascript
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { validateToken } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
```

2. Use the `validateToken` function from the Whop SDK to obtain the user's ID

```javascript
export default async function SellerPage() {
  const { userId } = await validateToken({ headers });
}
```

<Warning>
  You should **always** call `validateToken` on every page you define. Even if
  you do not care about the user's ID, you should validate it to ensure the user
  is not malicious.
</Warning>

At this point, the user is authenticated and we have their Whop User ID

## 3. Make sure the user has access to this company

We now want to check to make sure this user is an authorized team member of the company they are browsing. To do this, we will use the `hasAccess` function from the **Whop SDK**.

1. **Update the Whop SDK imports**

```javascript
import { validateToken, hasAccess, authorizedUserOn } from "@whop-apps/sdk";
```

2. **Check if the user is an authorized user of the company**

To check if the user should be able to access this page, we will use the `hasAccess` function. This function takes in an object with two properties:

- `to`: The resource the user is trying to access. In this case, it will be the company ID
- `headers`: The headers of the request - this allows the SDK to get information about the user.

<Note>
  As we are checking a company ID, we need to use the `authorizedUserOn`
  function. This prefixes the company ID with `authorized-`. If you are not
  using company ID, you can pass the ID directly to `to`
</Note>

```javascript
const access = await hasAccess({
  to: authorizedUserOn(params.companyId),
  headers,
});
```

3. **Handle the result**

If the user is not authorized, `access` will be `false`. If the user is authorized, `access` will be `true`. Now, we are going to throw an error if the user is not authorized.

```javascript
if (!access) {
  return <h1>You do not have access to view this company</h1>;
}
```

At this point, you have checked with the Whop SDK to ensure this user has access to view this page.

## 4. Display specific company info

Now that we can guarantee the user has access to view information about this company, let's display some info

1. **Update the Whop SDK imports**

We can use the Whop API to get information about the current company. To do this, you will need to import the `WhopAPI` function.

```javascript
import {
  validateToken,
  hasAccess,
  authorizedUserOn,
  WhopAPI,
} from "@whop-apps/sdk";
```

2. **Fetch the company information**

Now that we have imported the Whop API function, we can use it to fetch the company's information. We are passing in the company ID we got from the path parameters.

```javascript
const companyInformation = await WhopAPI.app().GET("/app/companies/{id}", {
  params: { path: { id: params.companyId } },
});
```

3. **Handle potential errors**

To make sure that we can retrieve the data we want from the result, we first need to check if the request was successful. If the request is not successful, we will display an error message.

```javascript
if (companyInformation.isErr) {
  console.log(companyInformation.error.message);
  return <p>Could not fetch company information</p>;
}
```

4. **Display the information**

Now that we have the company information, we can parse it and display the information

```javascript
const { title } = companyInformation.data;

return <h1>You are currently looking at my app from {title}</h1>;
```

Voila! Go reload your iFrame view and you should see the company title!
