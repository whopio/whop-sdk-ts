To build a Whop app, follow these steps.

1. Create a whop app on the dashboard and get your api keys.
2. Setup your development environment
3. Build your app view page. Either experience view or dashboard view.
4. Deploy to production
5. Apply to discover

## Create your Whop app.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to your company dashboard">
        Navigate to the [developer page](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer).
        Find the app section underneath webhooks
        <Info>
            You cannot change the company that your app is built in later.
        </Info>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create your app">
        Click on "Create App" and give it a name. You can change this later.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Copy your environment variables">
        You will need these to run your app and access the api.

## Setup your development environment

You can build whop apps in any programming language and framework.
Our SDKs are currently available in
[Javascript / Typescript](https://npmjs.com/package/@whop/sdk),
[Python](https://pypi.org/project/whop-sdk),
[Ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/whop-sdk) and
Go (coming soon)

If you are new, the easiest way to get started is to use our [NextJS template](https://github.com/whopio/whop-nextjs-app-template).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create your app">
        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash NextJS
            pnpm create next-app@latest \
                -e https://github.com/whopio/whop-nextjs-app-template \
                my_whop_app

            cd my_whop_app
            ```

            ```bash Python
            # we don't have an app template for python yet,
            # We recommend making a Fast API / Django / Flask app
            # and installing our sdk
            pip install whop-sdk
            ```

            ```bash Ruby
            # we don't have an app template for ruby yet,
            # We recommend making a Ruby on Rails app
            # and installing our sdk
            gem install whop_sdk
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Setup your SDK">
        1. Paste your environment variables from above into a `.env.development.local` file in your project.

        2. Initialize the Whop SDK with the environment variables and export it so it can be reused throughout your app.

            <Note>This is already done in the NextJS template. Find it at `./lib/whop-sdk.ts`</Note>


            <CodeGroup>
            ```typescript NextJS
            import Whop from "@whop/sdk";

            export const whopsdk = new Whop({
              apiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY, // This is the default and can be omitted
              appID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,
            });
            ```

            ```python Python
            import os
            from whop_sdk import Whop

            whop_sdk = Whop(
                api_key=os.environ.get("WHOP_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
                app_id=os.environ.get("WHOP_APP_ID"), # This is the default and can be omitted
            )
            ```

            ```ruby Ruby
            require "bundler/setup"
            require "whop_sdk"

            whop_sdk = WhopSDK::Client.new(
              api_key: ENV["WHOP_API_KEY"], # This is the default and can be omitted
              app_id: ENV["WHOP_APP_ID"], # This is the default and can be omitted
            )
            ```
            </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start your development server">
        <CodeGroup>
        ```bash NextJS
        pnpm dev
        ```

        ```bash Other Frameworks
        # First terminal
        rails server --port 5000 # or whatever your local dev command is

        # second terminal - run whop dev proxy (see below for more info)
        npx @whop-apps/dev-proxy --standalone --upstreamPort=5000 --proxyPort=3000
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

        <Note>
            You need to run your dev server through the whop dev proxy. This is the default behaviour in the NextJS template. [Learn more](/apps/guides/dev-proxy)
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure your app views">
        The app view determines the initial path that is opened when you app is loaded in the whop UI.

        If you are building a consumer focussed app for members, ensure your "App View" is set to `/experiences/[experienceId]`. (This is the default)

        If you are building a dashboard app for business owners, remove the "App View" and set the "Dashboard View" to `/dashboard/[companyId]`

        > Configure this in the "Hosting" section in your App Details tab in the App Dashboard

        <Frame>
            ![App Views](/images/app-settings-hosting.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Install your whop app">
        Visit your install link (which can be found on your app details page)
        and install your app into your whop.

        <Frame>
            ![App Install Button](/images/app-settings-install-app-button.png)
        </Frame>

        If building a consumer app _(ie: "App path" is set)_ then this will take you
        to the experience view inside the "whop" view within your community.

        If building a dashboard app, _(ie: "Dashboard path" is set)_ this will take you to the
        dashboard view for you app inside the dashboard view of the company you selected during install.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enable development mode">
        The current page you're on will now show an error, as your app is missing the `Base Url` for production use.

        For now, enable `Localhost mode` using the development mode setting overlay in the app frame.
        This will load the app that's running on localhost in your setup.

        <Info>
            If you are building using an online AI coding platform, directly set the `Base URL`
            to the URL provided by the platform. In this case, you don't need "Localhost" mode.
        </Info>

<Check>You should now see your local development environment live inside whop.</Check>

## Build your app view page.

## Deploy to production

## Apply to discover

Apply to discover to have your app listed on the Whop app store.

<Note>
    You don't need to be listed on the app store in order to use your app.

    You can always share your install link directly or link to from your website.
