2. Setup your development environment
3. Build your app view page. Either experience view or dashboard view.
4. Deploy to production
5. Apply to discover

## Create your Whop app.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to your company dashboard">
        Navigate to the [developer page](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer).
        Find the app section underneath webhooks
        <Info>
            You cannot change the company that your app is built in later.
        </Info>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create your app">
        Click on "Create App" and give it a name. You can change this later.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Copy your environment variables">
        You will need these to run your app and access the api.

## Setup your development environment

You can build whop apps in any programming language and framework.
Our SDKs are currently available in
[Javascript / Typescript](https://npmjs.com/package/@whop/sdk),
[Python](https://pypi.org/project/whop-sdk),
[Ruby](https://rubygems.org/gems/whop-sdk) and
Go (coming soon)

If you are new, the easiest way to get started is to use our [NextJS template](https://github.com/whopio/whop-nextjs-app-template).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create your app">
        <CodeGroup>
            ```bash NextJS
            pnpm create next-app@latest \
                -e https://github.com/whopio/whop-nextjs-app-template \
                my_whop_app

            cd my_whop_app
            ```

            ```bash Python
            # we don't have an app template for python yet,
            # We recommend making a Fast API / Django / Flask app
            # and installing our sdk
            pip install whop-sdk
            ```

            ```bash Ruby
            # we don't have an app template for ruby yet,
            # We recommend making a Ruby on Rails app
            # and installing our sdk
            gem install whop_sdk
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Setup your SDK">
        1. Paste your environment variables from above into a `.env.development.local` file in your project.

        2. Initialize the Whop SDK with the environment variables and export it so it can be reused throughout your app.

            <Note>This is already done in the NextJS template. Find it at `./lib/whop-sdk.ts`</Note>


            <CodeGroup>
            ```typescript NextJS
            import Whop from "@whop/sdk";

            export const whopsdk = new Whop({
              apiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY, // This is the default and can be omitted
              appID: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,
            });
            ```

            ```python Python
            import os
            from whop_sdk import Whop

            whop_sdk = Whop(
                api_key=os.environ.get("WHOP_API_KEY"),  # This is the default and can be omitted
                app_id=os.environ.get("WHOP_APP_ID"), # This is the default and can be omitted
            )
            ```

            ```ruby Ruby
            require "bundler/setup"
            require "whop_sdk"

            whop_sdk = WhopSDK::Client.new(
              api_key: ENV["WHOP_API_KEY"], # This is the default and can be omitted
              app_id: ENV["WHOP_APP_ID"], # This is the default and can be omitted
            )
            ```
            </CodeGroup>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start your development server">
        <CodeGroup>
        ```bash NextJS
        pnpm dev
        ```

        ```bash Other Frameworks
        # First terminal
        rails server --port 5000 # or whatever your local dev command is

        # second terminal - run whop dev proxy (see below for more info)
        npx @whop-apps/dev-proxy --standalone --upstreamPort=5000 --proxyPort=3000
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

        <Note>
            You need to run your dev server through the whop dev proxy. This is the default behaviour in the NextJS template. [Learn more](/apps/guides/dev-proxy)
        </Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Configure your app views">
        The app view determines the initial path that is opened when your app is loaded in the whop UI.

        If you are building a consumer focussed app for members, ensure your "App View" is set to `/experiences/[experienceId]`. (This is the default)

        If you are building a dashboard app for business owners, remove the "App View" and set the "Dashboard View" to `/dashboard/[companyId]`

        > Configure this in the "Hosting" section in your App Details tab in the App Dashboard

        <Frame>
            ![App Views](/images/app-settings-hosting.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Install your whop app">
        Visit your install link (which can be found on your app details page)
        and install your app into your whop.

        <Frame>
            ![App Install Button](/images/app-settings-install-app-button.png)
        </Frame>

        If building a consumer app _(ie: "App path" is set)_ then this will take you
        to the experience view inside the "whop" view within your community.

        If building a dashboard app, _(ie: "Dashboard path" is set)_ this will take you to the
        dashboard view for you app inside the dashboard view of the company you selected during install.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enable development mode">
        The current page you're on will now show an error, as your app is missing the `Base Url` for production use.

        For now, enable `Localhost mode` using the development mode setting overlay in the app frame.
        This will load the app that's running on localhost in your setup.

        <Info>
            If you are building using an online AI coding platform, directly set the `Base URL`
            to the URL provided by the platform. In this case, you don't need "Localhost" mode.
        </Info>

        <Frame>
          <video
            autoPlay
            src="/how-to-videos/experience-app-preview-set-localhost.mp4"
            alt="Set localhost mode in the app frame"
          />
        </Frame>
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>You should now see your local development environment live inside whop.</Check>

## Build your app

You are now ready to start building your app.

Get started by looking into `./app/experiences/[experienceId]/page.tsx`
or `./app/dashboard/[companyId]/page.tsx` if you're building a dashboard app.

<Note>
    If you are building in a different framework create these files, such that your server responds to

    `GET /experience/exp_123` or `GET /dashboard/biz_123`
</Note>

Here are some tips for building your whop app

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Authenticate users and validate access">
    Use the `verifyUserToken` method to identify who is making requests to your app, then use `checkAccess` to verify they have permission to view the requested experience or company.

    ```typescript
    const { userId } = await whopsdk.verifyUserToken(await headers());
    const access = await whopsdk.users.checkAccess(experienceId, { id: userId });
    ```

    [Learn more about authentication](/apps/guides/authentication)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Frosted UI for beautiful components">
    Frosted UI provides pre-built components that automatically adapt to light and dark mode, matching the native Whop design system for a polished, professional look.

    ```bash
    npm install @whop/frosted-ui
    ```

    [Learn more about Frosted UI](/apps/guides/frosted_ui)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Accept payments in your app">
    Create checkout sessions and accept payments directly in your app using the Whop payment APIs. Handle one-time payments, subscriptions, and more with low fees.

    ```typescript
    const checkout = await whopsdk.checkoutConfigurations.create({
        company_id: "biz_xxx",
        // ... configuration
    });
    ```

    [Learn more about payments](/apps/guides/payins)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Setup webhooks to respond to events">
    Listen to events like new memberships, cancellations, and payments to keep your app in sync with Whop. Webhooks are sent in real-time to your server.

    ```typescript
    const event = whopsdk.webhooks.unwrap(...);
    ```

    [Learn more about webhooks](/apps/guides/webhooks)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Deploy to production

Once you are happy with your app locally, deploy your app to a publicly accessible hostname.

Popular options are [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Railway](https://railway.com) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com).

<Steps>
    <Step title="Set your environment variables on your hosting provider">
        Copy the environment variables from your app dashboard, as you did for the local setup.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set the base url in the app dashboard">
        Once your app is deployed, copy the deployment url and paste it into the `Base Url` field in your app dashboard.

        <Frame>
            ![Base url input box](/images/app-settings-base-url.png)
        </Frame>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Switch to production">
        Open the dev settings in the top right of your app and switch to production mode.
        Your app is now running in production and will work for all users.
    </Step>
</Steps>

#### Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Server actions don't work when deployed on vercel">
    Ensure you use the `withWhopAppConfig` wrapper in your `next.config.mjs` file.

    ```typescript
    // next.config.ts
    import type { NextConfig } from "next";
    import { withWhopAppConfig } from "@whop/react/next.config";

    const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
        // your config options
    };

    export default withWhopAppConfig(nextConfig);
    ```
</Accordion>

## Apply to discover

Apply to discover to have your app listed on the Whop app store.

<Note>
    You don't need to be listed on the app store in order to use your app.

    You can always share your install link directly or link to from your website.
</Note>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Complete your branding">
        1. Ensure your app has an Icon, short description and good name. (App Details tab)
        2. Select your app store category.
        3. Add a short 10-20 second video showcasing how your app is used. (Discover tab)
        4. Add 2-3 further screenshots of your app.
        5. Write an app store description that highlights what your app does and how it will benefit creators.

        <Info>
            You can preview your app store listing page at `https://whop.com/apps/<app_xxxxxx>`.
        </Info>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Submit for review">
        Click on the "Publish to App Store" button. Whop will review your app.

        To ensure that your app passes review ensure the following criteria are met:

        - [x] Your app works end to end, in production on any whop account without bugs.
        - [x] Your app uses the provided [whop authentication](/apps/guides/authentication) and doesn't ask users to sign in again.
        - [x] Your app isn't purely a redirect to an external platform.
        - [x] Your app does NOT ask for permissions it doesn't need to function.
        - [x] Your app is polished and looks good in both light and dark mode (switch between both in the bottom right on whop). [ProTip: Use FrostedUI](/apps/guides/frosted_ui)
        - [x] Your app delivers a clear creator-facing benefit or solves a specific problem.
        - [x] Your app delivers a measurable useful outcome (not just a demo or concept).
        - [x] Your app has no placeholder elements (all features are complete and functional).
        - [x] Members do not have access to admin details or settings (proper access control is implemented).
    </Step>

    <Step title="LFG 🚀 - Congratulations on building your first whop app">
        Your app will be reviewed within a few days. Once you are live you will get a DM from whop.

        Share your install link on X / Twitter. We're excited to see what you build!
    </Step>
