title: Payouts
description: Pay users and companies on whop
---

Your app can use the whop API to easily pay users and companies throughout the platform.
This allows your app to implement flexible and custom revenue sharing, user rewards or payouts solutions.

A transfer of balance is represented by the [`Transfer`](/api-reference/transfer/retrieve-transfer) resource in the API.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Choose your origin">
        By default, your app can pay out of it's owning company balance.
        For this step the origin of the transfer should be set to the company id that owns the app.

        You can find this in the URL when looking at your app dashboard (looks like `biz_XXXXXXXXX`)

        For advanced use cases, apps can also transfer balance from the accounts of other companies
        that the app is installed in. To do this you must request the `payout:transfer_funds` permission
        using the permission system.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Choose your destination">
        The destination id can be any valid user, company or ledger account id.
        These will look like `user_xxxxxx`, `biz_xxxxxx` or `ldgr_xxxxxx` respectively.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Make the transfer">
        Once you have your origin and destination, use the SDK or API to create a transfer.
        The funds will be transferred immediately.

            ```typescript Typescript
            const transfer = await client.transfers.create({
              amount: 6.9,
              currency: 'usd',
              destination_id: 'user_xxxxx',
              origin_id: 'biz_xxxxx',
              notes: 'Revenue share from MyApp',
            });
            ```

            ```python Python
            transfer = client.transfers.create(
                amount=6.9,
                currency="usd",
                destination_id="user_xxxxx",
                origin_id="biz_xxxxx",
                notes='Revenue share from MyApp',
            )
            ```

            ```ruby Ruby
            transfer = whop.transfers.create(
              amount: 6.9,
              currency: :usd,
              destination_id: "user_xxxxx",
              origin_id: "biz_xxxxx",
              notes: 'Revenue share from MyApp'
            )
            ```

            ```bash Curl
            curl --request POST \
              --url https://api.whop.com/api/v1/transfers \
              --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
              --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
              --data '{
              "amount": 6.9,
              "currency": "usd",
              "destination_id": "user_xxxxx",
              "notes": "Revenue share from MyApp",
              "origin_id": "biz_xxxxx"
            }'
            ```
        </CodeGroup>

        <Warning>
            When creating a transfer we recommend that you include an `idempotence_key` in the request body.
            An idempotence key will prevent 2 API calls with the same `idempotence_key` value
            from transferring money twice.

            For example, when implementing revenue sharing for every received payment, it is wise to derive the
            `idempotence_key` from the payment ID, meaning you will never share revenue from the same payment twice.

            Idempotence keys are scoped to your app.
        </Warning>
