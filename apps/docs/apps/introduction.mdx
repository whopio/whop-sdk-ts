# What are Whop apps?

Whop apps allow you to build and integrate your own custom software into Whop.
Leverage Whopâ€™s payments, authentication, and distribution infrastructure to launch and monetize your ideas.
Use our SDKs and APIs to programmatically access data and create custom user experiences on and off the platform.

Below are some common use cases for whop apps.

### B2B Apps

Build dashboard apps that directly enhance the functionality of the whop business dashboard.

These apps can provide custom UI visible to creators directly inside their dashboard,
and they can access rich data about the company, such as payments data, member information and more.

<Info>
    For example, you can build an app that uses the [Member](/api-reference/members/list-members),
    [Plan](/api-reference/plans/create-plan) and [Promo Code](/api-reference/promo-codes/create-promo-code) APIs
    to allow creators to send upsells to loyal customers via email.
</Info>

### Consumer Apps

Consumer apps on whop can provide custom _experiences_ to members of a whop. They are displayed right
inline with native whop experiences such as chat, forums and courses.

After installing your app, creators can spawn one or more experiences powered by your app.
An `Experience` on whop maps to a single item in the whop's sidebar. Each one can render a unique custom view.

<Info>
    For example, you can build an app that allows creators to run LIVE quizzes directly within their community.
    Associate quizzes with the provided experience id parameter, allow admins to create and manage the quizzes
    and allow members to vote and see results.
</Info>

### External Integrations

Build a whop app to integrate your existing app, service or platform with Whop.
Use our payment APIs, webhooks, OAuth and embedded checkout to supercharge your existing app.

As whop apps can be installed on multiple companies this allows your integration to be multi-tenant,
allowing it to be used by multiple creators.

<Info>
    For example, you can create [Checkout Configurations](/api-reference/checkout-configurations/create-checkout-configuration)
    and [Embedded Checkout](/payments/checkout-embed) to create dynamic checkouts for customers on your external site.
    Receive [webhooks](/apps/guides/webhooks) when the payments settle and automatically fulfill orders.
