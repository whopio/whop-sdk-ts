---


Whop apps are composed of **views** - different pages you build into your app that users interact with. Understanding these views is essential for creating a complete app experience.

## App Views

Your app consists of three main types of views:

### Experience Views

An **experience** is an instance of your app when someone installs it into their Whop. Think of it as a unique deployment of your app for a specific community or business. The **experience view** is what users see when they install your app into their Whop and click into it. This is the core functionality of your app - where users interact with your features and services.

- **Route**: Typically `/experiences/[experienceId]`
- **Access**: Private, gated through the Whop SDK
- **Purpose**: Deliver the main app functionality to authorized users

### Discover Views

The **discover view** is a new public-facing view that helps potential users explore what your app offers. This view showcases your app's capabilities and highlights success stories from other communities.

- **Route**: Public page accessible to anyone
- **Access**: No authentication required
- **Purpose**: Marketing and discovery, showcasing app value and success stories

#### Linking to Whops & Showcasing Success

To further promote your app and earn affiliate fees, consider linking to other Whops that use your app and have seen success. You can do this by adding links on your discover view to the Whop's discover page at `/discover/{accessPassRoute}/`, appending your app's ID as a query parameter: `?app={yourAppId}`. For example:

```
/discover/{accessPassRoute}/?app={yourAppId}
```

This not only helps potential users see real-world examples of your app in action, but also allows you to earn affiliate commissions for any referrals.

> **How to get the access pass route:**
> You can use the [Whop SDK](/sdk/api/experiences/list-access-passes-for-experience) to find the `accessPass_route` by experience ID. This will return the access passes for that experience, including the route you can use for linking.

When building discover views, include a **64px margin** on your top-level content to prevent it from being hidden by the iframe header.

### Dashboard Views

The **dashboard view** is a new business-focused view that allows creators to access apps directly from their dashboard. This view is designed for apps that help businesses grow and manage operations.

- **Route**: Typically `/dashboard/[companyId]`
- **Access**: Private, gated through the Whop SDK
- **Purpose**: Provide creators direct access to apps from their dashboard

## Building Experience Views

Our template projects come preconfigured with Whop authentication logic, so you can guarantee users have proper access and retrieve the appropriate IDs and permissions before performing app logic.

If your app requires storing data in an external database,  can use these IDs to properly scope data to the correct experiences and user IDs:

- **Experience ID**: Scope data to specific app installations
- **User ID**: Associate data with individual users

## Monetization with Discover Views

You can collect affiliate fees by linking out to Whops from your discover page. Simply append the query parameter `?app={yourAppId} to Whop links to track referrals and earn commissions.

## Testing Your App Locally

To test your app during development:

1. Go to [whop.com](https://whop.com) and install your app
2. Navigate to your app details page
3. Set your local paths and environment variables
4. Then click on your app in the sidebar
5. You should see a dev toggle option in the top right. Click on this set the environment to local to preview your local app as you develop,
6. You can switch between experience and discover views to test both interfaces
7. When you are ready to publish, make sure your app base url is set, and you are good to go.

This allows you to develop and test your app locally while maintaining the full Whop integration experience.
