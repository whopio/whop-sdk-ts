## Why GraphQL

GraphQL is an API interface (alternative to REST) that allows for rapid development and iterative changes to evolving objects.
Whop has built its core product and internal APIs using GraphQL for years, and is now exposing most of the same functionality
via a publicly accessible version.

## Available endpoints

You can explore all available queries and mutations using our Apollo OS explorer:

üîó [GraphQL Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/whop-public-gql/variant/current/explorer)

To make a call, you must pass the following headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_APP_API_KEY
x-on-behalf-of: user_1NqS34mOp24
x-company-id: biz_Nq4S34mfp59
Content-Type: application/json
```

| Header           | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Authorization`  | Get from [here](/what-to-build/agentic-businesses#step-1%3A-create-your-app). Must be prefixed with "Bearer". |
| `x-on-behalf-of` | Specifies the User ID of the account you're making requests on behalf of.                                     |
| `x-company-id`   | Specifies the Biz ID to target the business of a user you are calling from.                                   |
| `Content-Type`   | Specifies the format of the request payload as JSON.                                                          |

#### Who can you make requests on behalf of?

Your app can make calls on behalf of users in three ways. Any of these methods grant full access to automating the user's account:

- The User is the original creator of the organization in which your app was created (Ex. your own User ID)
- The User is an Agent User created by the app [here](/what-to-build/agentic-businesses#step-1%3A-create-your-app)
- The User has joined a whop that has installed your app

## API Capabilities

This GraphQL API provides **powerful** access to the entire Whop ecosystem, allowing developers to build sophisticated integrations and applications. Through the API, you can access and manipulate all core Whop functionality, including:

- User management
- Store and product handling
- Messages, forum posts, and live streams
