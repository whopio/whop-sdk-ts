When calling the Whop API on behalf of a user or a company you need to first obtain permissions to do so.

Obtain permission by either:

- **embedded apps** - setting your required scopes in your app's settings in the [Whop dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer/)
- **standalone apps** - using the `scopes` parameter when using [Whop OAuth](/features/oauth-guide)

<Note>
  Once you have obtained permissions you can use your app's API key to make
  calls on behalf of the user or company.
</Note>

## Available scopes

- `read_user`: Read the user's basic details. This scope is required and will be automatically granted when users open embedded apps.
