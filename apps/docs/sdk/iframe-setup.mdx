description: Getting started with the Whop iFrame SDK
---

Whop apps are embedded into the site using iFrames. This SDK provides a type-safe way for you to communicate with the Whop application using a request/response style API powered by `window.postMessage`.

Since this package relies on `window.postMessage`, it only works in **Client Components**.

---

## Setup

The main function exported from this package is the `createAppIframeSDK` function. When called, this function sets up a listener for messages from the main Whop site, using `window.on('message', ...)`.

### Next.js Setup

If you're using Next.js, you'll need to make sure that you're only calling `createAppIframeSDK` on the client. You can do this by using a `client` layout defined in the root of your app.

Here is an example of the project structure:

```
app/
├─ layout.tsx
├─ layout.client.tsx
lib/
├─ iframe.ts
```

```javascript app/layout.tsx
import { ClientLayout } from "./layout.client";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <ClientLayout>{children}</ClientLayout>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

Next.js Will mount this code on the client:

```javascript app/layout.client.tsx
"use client"; // this line is important
import { FC, PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import "@/lib/iframe";

export const ClientLayout: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  return <>{children}</>;
};
```

We declare the SDK in a separate file, such that we can import it throughout the rest of the app.

```javascript lib/iframe.ts
import { createAppIframeSDK } from "@whop-apps/sdk";

export const WhopApp = createAppIframeSDK({
  onMessage: {},
});
```
