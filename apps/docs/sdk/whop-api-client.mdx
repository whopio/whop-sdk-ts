title: Set up the API client
description: We provide a TS client that makes it super easy to use our API. We highly recommend you use this client.
---

Our SDK makes it simple to use our API. It's a wrapper around our GraphQL API with pre-built functions for all of our endpoints. The endpoints are outlined in the SDK reference section of our docs.

### Install

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @whop/api
```

```bash npm
npm install @whop/api
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @whop/api
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setup your client

Create a new file that instantiates the client and exports it. We recommend putting this file at `lib/whop-sdk.ts`.

This file reads your ENV keys, which can be found on your app developer page on the Whop dashboard.

```ts
import { WhopServerSdk, makeUserTokenVerifier } from "@whop/api";

export const whopSdk = WhopServerSdk({
  // This is the appId of your app. You can find this in the "App Settings" section of your app's Whop dashboard.
  // This is required.
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID ?? "fallback",

  // Add your app api key here - this is required.
  // You can get this from the Whop dashboard after creating an app in the "API Keys" section.
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY ?? "fallback",

  // This will make api requests on behalf of this user.
  // This is optional, however most api requests need to be made on behalf of a user.
  // You can create an agent user for your app, and use their userId here.
  // You can also apply a different userId later with the `withUser` function.
  onBehalfOfUserId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID,

  // This is the companyId that will be used for the api requests.
  // When making api requests that query or mutate data about a company, you need to specify the companyId.
  // This is optional, however if not specified certain requests will fail.
  // This can also be applied later with the `withCompany` function.
  companyId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID,
});
```

### Example usage

The rest of the examples in this section will use this client and import it from `lib/whop-sdk.ts`.

Here is an example

```ts
import { whopSdk } from "./lib/whop-sdk";

const user = await whopSdk.users.getCurrentUser();
```
