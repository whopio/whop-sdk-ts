```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

const result = await whopApi.listMessages({
	// The type of feed to fetch from
	type: "chat_feed" /* Valid values: chat_feed | dms_feed | forum_feed | livestream_feed | universal_post | user */ /* Required! */,
	// The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `"4"`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.
	id: "Error" /* Required! */,
});
