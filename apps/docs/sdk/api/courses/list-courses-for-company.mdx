```

### Example output

```typescript
const result = {
	// The courses in the company's experiences
	courses: {
		// A list of nodes.
		nodes: [
			{
				// The ID of the course. Looks like cors_XXX
				id: "xxxxxxxxxxx",

				// The title of the course
				title: "some string",

				// The URL of the course's cover image, which is shown in course preview cards
				coverImage: "some string",

				// The experience that the course belongs to
				experience: {
					// The unique ID representing this experience
					id: "xxxxxxxxxxx",

					// The access passes that are associated with this experience. This should not be
					// used unless you are trying to list all access passes the experience has, for
					// some reason. You probably don't want to use this though and should be using accessPass.
					accessPasses: [
						{
							// The internal ID of the public product.
							id: "xxxxxxxxxxx",

							// The title of the product. Use for Whop 4.0.
							title: "some string",
						},
					],
				},
			},
		],

		// The total number of items in this connection.
		totalCount: 10,

		// Information to aid in pagination.
		pageInfo: {
			// When paginating forwards, are there more items?
			hasNextPage: true,

			// When paginating forwards, the cursor to continue.
			endCursor: "some string",
		},
	},
};
