### Usage

```typescript
import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";

const result = await whopSdk.experiences.listAccessPassesForExperience({
	// The ID of the experience
	experienceId: "exp_XXXXXXXX" /* Required! */,
});

```

### Example output

```typescript
const result = {
	// The unique ID representing this experience
	experienceId: "xxxxxxxxxxx",

	// The access passes that are associated with this experience. This should not be
	// used unless you are trying to list all access passes the experience has, for
	// some reason. You probably don't want to use this though and should be using accessPass.
	accessPasses: [
		{
			// The internal ID of the public access pass.
			id: "xxxxxxxxxxx",

			// The title of the access pass. Use for Whop 4.0.
			title: "some string",

			// A short description of what the company offers or does.
			shortenedDescription: "some string",

			// Whether this product is Whop verified.
			verified: true,

			// This access pass will/will not be displayed publicly.
			visibility:
				"archived" /* Valid values: archived | hidden | quick_link | visible */,

			// The route of the access pass.
			route: "some string",

			// The number of active users for this access pass.
			activeUsersCount: 10,

			// The logo for the access pass.
			logo: {
				// The original URL of the attachment, such as a direct link to S3. This should
				// never be displayed on the client and always passed to an Imgproxy transformer.
				sourceUrl: "some string",
			},
		},
	],
};
