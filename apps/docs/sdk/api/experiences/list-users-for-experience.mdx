```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

const result = await whopApi.listUsersForExperience({
	// The ID of the experience
	experienceId: "exp_XXXXXXXX" /* Required! */,

	after: "pageInfo.endCursor",

	before: "pageInfo.startCursor",

	direction: "asc" /* Valid values: asc | desc */,

	first: 10,
});

```

Example output:

```typescript
const response = {
	// Fetch an experience.
	publicExperience: {
		// The users that have access to this experience. This field will return nil if
		// you aren't authorized to view this experience's users. You must have a
		// membership or be a team member for the experience to view the user list.
		users: {
			// A list of nodes.
			nodes: [
				{
					// The internal ID of the user.
					id: "xxxxxxxxxxx",

					// The username of the user from their Whop account.
					username: "some string",

					// The user's profile picture
					profilePicture: {
						// This is the URL you use to render optimized attachments on the client. This should be used for apps.
						url: "some string",
					},
				},
			],

			// Information to aid in pagination.
			pageInfo: {
				// When paginating forwards, the cursor to continue.
				endCursor: "some string",

				// When paginating forwards, are there more items?
				hasNextPage: true,

				// When paginating backwards, are there more items?
				hasPreviousPage: true,
			},

			// The total number of items in this connection.
			totalCount: 10,
		},
	},
};
