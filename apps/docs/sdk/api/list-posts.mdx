## List Feed Messages

Use the following snippet to fetch messages from a feed. You'll need to provide the feed type and its ID.

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";


const feedMessages = (await whopApi.listMessages({type: "chat_feed", id: "exp_xxx"})).feedPosts;

console.log(feedMessages.posts);
```
