	appStoreDescription: "some string",

	// The base production url of the app
	baseUrl: "some string",

	// The path for the hub view of the app
	experiencePath: "some string",

	// The icon for the app
	icon: {
		// This ID should be used the first time you upload an attachment. It is the ID
		// of the direct upload that was created when uploading the file to S3 via the
		// mediaDirectUpload mutation.
		directUploadId: "xxxxxxxxxxx",

		// The ID of an existing attachment object. Use this when updating a resource and
		// keeping a subset of the attachments. Don't use this unless you know what you're doing.
		id: "xxxxxxxxxxx",
	},

	// The ID of the app
	id: "xxxxxxxxxxx" /* Required! */,

	// The name of the app
	name: "some string",

	// The scopes that the app will request off of users when a user installs the app.
	requiredScopes: ["read_user" /* Valid values: read_user */],

	// If the status is live, the app is visible on Whop discovery. In order to be
	// live, you need to set the name, icon, and description. Being unlisted or
	// hidden means it's not visible on Whop but you can still install the app via
	// direct link. To remove the app from whop discovery, you should set the status to unlisted.
	status: "hidden" /* Valid values: hidden | live | unlisted */,
});
