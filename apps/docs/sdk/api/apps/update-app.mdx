		// of the direct upload that was created when uploading the file to S3 via the
		// mediaDirectUpload mutation.
		directUploadId: "xxxxxxxxxxx",

		// The ID of an existing attachment object. Use this when updating a resource and
		// keeping a subset of the attachments. Don't use this unless you know what you're doing.
