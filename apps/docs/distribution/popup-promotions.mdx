Popup promotions catch visitors right before they leave your store page empty-handed. They show a discount offer to people who've been browsing for 45\+ seconds or are about to click away.

Think of it as an extra chance to turn a browser into a buyer. Plus, even if they don't purchase immediately, you capture their contact info so you can follow up later.

## Enable popup promotions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access your store settings" titleSize="h3">
    Go to your **Dashboard** and click **Edit store page** under the Admin area of your whop, then click the **Edit details** button on the store page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Turn on popup promotions" titleSize="h3">
    In the Edit details popup, scroll down to find the **Enable popup promotion** setting and toggle it on.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set up your popup promotion

When you enable popup promotions, you'll see additional settings appear:

- **Set your discount percentage**: Use the **Discount percentage** field to decide how much of a deal you want to offer. This is what visitors will see when they've been browsing for 45\+ seconds or are trying to leave your store page (showing exit intent).

<Tip>
  Pro tip: Test different discount amounts. Start with a 10-15% discount and adjust based on your conversion rates.
