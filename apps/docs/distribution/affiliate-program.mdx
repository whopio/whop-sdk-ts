Set up your affiliate program to reward people for bringing new members to your whop.

## How the affiliate program works

The Whop Affiliate Program works on a simple principle: when someone uses a referral link to join your whop and makes a purchase, the person who referred them earns a commission.

Here's how it works:

- You turn on the affiliate program 
- Users get access to their unique affiliate link for your whop
- They share their link anywhere they want
- When someone joins through their link, Whop automatically tracks the referral and pays the commission
- You can customize commission rates anytime to fit your business model

## How to set up your affiliate program

You have full control over your affiliate program settings. You can set different commission rates for different audiences and even create custom rates for specific users or partnerships.

### How to access your affiliate settings

To manage your affiliate program:

1. Go to your **Dashboard**
2. Make sure you're viewing the correct whop using the selection modal at the top left
3. Click the **Marketing** dropdown
4. Select **Affiliates**

You'll see three main sections:

- **Statistics** showing new users and revenue from affiliates
- **Buttons** to set commission rates
- A **leaderboard** of your top affiliates

### How to set commission rates for your whop

1. Click **Set the affiliate commission for a specific whop**
2. You'll see all your whops with two key settings:
   - **Global affiliate rate:** This is the commission rate offered to any user who refers others to your whop. The default is 30%, but you can adjust it to any percentage you prefer.
   - **Member affiliate rate:** This is the commission rate specifically for your existing members who refer others. This allows you to reward your community differently than general affiliates (e.g. members get 50% commission, while the global rate is 30%)

<Tip>
  If you set the 'Member affiliate rate' to 0%, members will earn the global affiliate rate instead.
