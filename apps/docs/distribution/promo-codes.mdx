Promo codes let you offer discounts to boost sales and drive conversions. Create percentage discounts (like 10% off) or fixed amounts (like \$10 off) in just a few clicks.

They're perfect for limited-time sales, closing hesitant customers, or running flash promotions.

## How to create a promo code

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access your dashboard" titleSize="h3">
    Head over to your **Dashboard.**

    <Tip>
      Make sure you're viewing the whop you want to create a discount for (using the whop selection modal at the top left). 
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Promo codes" titleSize="h3">
    Click the **Marketing** dropdown in the sections list and select **Promo codes**. You'll see any existing promo codes you've already created for your whop here.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new code" titleSize="h3">
    Click **Create promo code** at the top right of your screen. A popup will appear where you'll set up your code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your promo code" titleSize="h3">
    This popup has 8 sections to customize your code:

    1. **Code**: This is the actual promo code name, like "SAVE20" or "WELCOME10." Type what you want your code to be called.
    2. **Discount**: Decide how much your discount will be
       - Use the dropdown to pick either a **Percentage** (like 10% off) or a **Fixed amount** (like \$10 off).
       - Then, enter the discount value in the field above the dropdown.
    3. **Discount duration:** Decide how long the discount applies
       - **One-time (default)**: The discount is applied only once.
       - **Forever**: The discount applies to all future payments.
       - **Multiple months**: The discount applies for a specific number of months (a field will pop up for you to enter the number).
    4. **Eligible users**: Who can use this code?
       - **Everyone (default)**: Anyone can use it.
       - **Only new**: Only new customers can use this code.
       - **Only churned**: Only previous customers who have left can use it.
    5. **Expires**: Set when the promo code expires using the date and time selector. This is enabled by default and set to one month from creation.
    6. **Usage limit section**: Enter the maximum number of times this code can be used. Default is set to 100 uses.
    7. **One per customer**: If you enable this, each customer can only use the promo code once. This is enabled by default. 
    8. **Apply to specific whops**: This is off by default. If you turn it on, you can limit the promo code to certain checkout links within your organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activate your code" titleSize="h3">
    Once everything looks good, click **Create** at the bottom of the popup to make your promo code live. You'll now see your new promo code in the list, showing details like where it applies, the discount, how many times it can be used, and how many times it's already been used.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Manually expire a promo code

If you need to deactivate a promo code before its set expiration date, you can manually expire it.

1. **Access the promo code options**: Click the three dots (context menu button) next to the promo code you want to expire.
2. **Click Expire**: Select **Expire** from the dropdown menu that appears.
3. **Confirm expiration**: A confirmation message will pop up. Click **Expire** to permanently deactivate the promo code.

<Warning>
  When a promo code is expired, you can't reactivate it. If you want to offer that same discount again, you'll need to create a brand new promo code.
</Warning>


And that's it\! Your promo codes are now ready to help you drive sales and grow your business.
