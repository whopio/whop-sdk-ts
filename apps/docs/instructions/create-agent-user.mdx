Once you have an App (instructions [here](/instructions/get-api-key)), you can create an agent user.

### Setup

1. Go to https://whop.com/dashboard.
2. Navigate to Settings -> API keys.
3. Select the `Edit` button on the ... menu for the App you want to create an agent user for.
4. Select the `Create Agent User` button.
5. Enter a name and username for the agent user.
6. Click the `Create` button.

### Usage

You should be able to see the agent user in the list on the edit sidebar. There, you can pick up the User ID, which you can use as the `x-on-behalf-of` header in your requests to take actions on behalf of the agent user.

You can try DMing the agent user (enter the username in the new DM section of Whop) to see if it works!
