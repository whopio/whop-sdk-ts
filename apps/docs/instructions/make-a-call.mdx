# Using Your API Key to Make API Calls

Once you have [obtained your App API key](/instructions/get-api-key), you can use it to interact with the Whop API endpoints listed in the GraphQL documentation on the [Apollo Studio Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/whop-public-gql/variant/current/explorer).

## Making a GraphQL API Call

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have a tool or library to make HTTP requests, such as `curl`, Postman, or a GraphQL client in your preferred programming language.

### 2. Prepare Your Request

#### Endpoint
Use the GraphQL endpoint: `https://api.whop.com/public-graphql`

#### Headers
Include your API key in the headers to authenticate your request:

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
x-on-behalf-of: user_123
x-company-id: biz_123
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Headers Explained

##### `x-on-behalf-of`
This header specifies which User account you are using to make requests. This needs to be a User ID of an account your application has access to. 

Your app can access users in three ways. Any of these methods grant full access to automating the user's account:
- The User is the owner of the application (Ex. Your own User ID)
- The User is an Agent User created by the App
- The User has "installed" / "subscribed" the App by claiming a Membership

##### `x-company-id`
This header specifies a Company to target when making requests to the GraphQL API. 

Whenever you are making requests that involve managing a creators' whops, you'll need to supply this ID.
For example, when using the `createPlan`, `createAccessPass`, or `refundReceipt` mutations. The user you are making
requests for needs to be an owner / team member of the specified company in order for the API calls to succeed.

##### `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
This header specifies the API key you are using to make requests. This should be an App API key.

### 3. Craft Your Query

Write your GraphQL query or mutation.

**Example: Retrieve user data**
```graphql
query myCurrentUser {
  viewer {
    user {
      id
      username
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

**Example: Retrieve company data**
```graphql
query myCurrentCompany {
  viewer {
    company {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}
```

**Example: Update a user profile**
```graphql
mutation updateMyCurrentUser {
  updateUser(input: { name: "John Doe" }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### 4. Send the Request

Use your tool to send the request to the GraphQL endpoint.

### 5. Handle the Response

Process the response from the server, which will include the data requested or any errors encountered.

## Example Request Using `curl`

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.whop.com/public-graphql \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "x-on-behalf-of: user_123" \
  -H "x-company-id: biz_123" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "query": "query { user { id name email } }" }'
```
