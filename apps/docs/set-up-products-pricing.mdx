Products are how you package and price what you're offering on Whop. Think of them as different membership tiers or access levels for your business.

You can offer free access, one-time payments, or recurring subscriptions - whatever works best for your business.

## How to set up pricing for your whop

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add a product" titleSize="h3">
    To set up pricing, you need to create a product:

    - Go to your whop
    - Click **Products**
    - Click **Add product**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your product details" titleSize="h3">
    Now you'll configure the core details of your product:

    - **Choose a title**: Keep it clear and descriptive (e.g., "Premium Membership", "Full Course Access")
    - Select your pricing option:
      - **Free**: Give customers free access to your whop
      - **One-time**: Charge customers once for lifetime access
      - **Recurring**: Set up monthly or yearly subscriptions
    - **Choose currency**: Select the currency you want to charge in
    - **Set your price**: Enter how much customers will pay
      - If you chose recurring, also choose your billing cycle length (weekly, monthly, yearly)
    - **Configure advanced options** (optional):
      - **Stock**: Limit how many people can purchase this product
      - **Show on store page**: Make this product visible on your public store page
      - **Add a waitlist**: Users enter payment details but aren't charged until you approve them
      - **Ask questions before checkout**: Collect information from customers before they purchase
      - **Auto-expire access**: Automatically remove access after a set time period
      - **Redirect after checkout**: Send customers to a specific page after they complete checkout
      - **Add internal name**: A name only you can see on your dashboard
    - **Choose payment methods**: Select what customers can pay with
      - Credit/debit card
      - Bank transfer (ACH)
      - PayPal
      - Cryptocurrency
      - Buy now, pay later (Financing)

    <Tip>
      If you want to offer multiple pricing options (like both monthly and yearly plans), click Add another billing period.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose which apps customers get with this product" titleSize="h3">
    This is where you decide what customers actually get when they purchase your product. When users purchase or claim your product, they will get access to the apps you select.

    - **Toggle on** all the apps you want to include in this product
    - **Toggle off** any apps you don't want included in this product

    <Tip>
      You can create multiple products with different app combinations. For example, create a free product that gives access to basic apps, and a premium product that unlocks premium apps.
    </Tip>
    When you're happy with everything, click **Add Product**.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Understanding products: Different ways to structure your whop

Your whop can contain multiple products, each acting like a different membership option. You might have a basic tier and premium tier, or just one all-access option - it's completely up to you.

**Common examples:**

- **One product:** "Full Access" (\$49/month) with all apps included
- **Two products:** "Free Community" (chat only) \+ "Premium" (\$29/month, all apps)
- **Three products:** Basic (\$19), Pro (\$49), VIP (\$99) with different app combinations

<Tip>
  Start simple with one product and add more later as your business grows.
