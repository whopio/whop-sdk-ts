Imagine being able to sell any software as your own product, complete with built-in payments, user management, and mobile access. That's exactly what Whop apps enable.

Use apps to give your customers new experiences or to level up internal operations for your business.

## What types of apps are there?

Whop apps fall into two broad themes:

- **Community-focused apps** – Chat, courses, live events, forums, and other social experiences that keep members engaged. See the full list in [Apps for communities](/apps/docs/whop-apps/apps-for-communities).
- **Business-focused apps** – Market data feeds, SaaS tools, and utilities that open new revenue streams or streamline operations. Explore examples in [Apps for businesses](/apps/docs/whop-apps/apps-for-businesses).

## Build your own app

If you can’t find the exact experience you need or want to build an app for tens of thousands of businesses on Whop, you can build an app.
