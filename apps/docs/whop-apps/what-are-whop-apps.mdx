Apps are the building blocks for your business on Whop. 

Here’s how it works: You create your own whop, then pick and choose which apps to include. Want a chat room for your community? Add the **Chat** app. Selling a course? Add the **Course** app. 

There are dozens of apps to choose from, and you can add any of them with just one click.

Each app becomes a feature that your members get access to when they join your whop.

## What apps should you add?

The apps you choose depend on your business model and what your audience values most. Here's how to think about it:

### Common apps that work across all business models

Some examples include:

- **Chat**: Create group chats where your members can talk, share ideas, and build community around your brand
- **Course**: Build multi-lesson courses with videos, quizzes, and progress tracking to educate your audience
- **Events**: Host virtual or in-person events and optionally charge per ticket for exclusive access
- **Document**: Create Notion-style pages with text, images, and embedded media to share important information
- **Calendar Bookings**: Let members book time slots with you, with optional payment per booking for one-on-one sessions
- **Content Rewards**: Pay members to post about your brand on social media and pay them based on the views they generate
- **Files**: Share downloadable files, documents, templates, or any digital assets your members need

### Niche apps for specific business models

Beyond the basics, there are specialized apps designed for specific types of communities. Some examples include:

**For trading communities**

- **Paper trading app**: Users can practice trading public markets with fake money inside your whop
- **Trading indicators app**: Let you sell custom trading indicators and analysis tools

**For reselling communities**

- **Marketplace app**: Create a space where your users can buy and sell products with each other
- **Resale price database app:** Track current and past values for various products and collectibles

**For AI communities**

- **Prompt library app**: Create, share, and sell AI prompts to help members get better results from AI tools
- **AI image generator app**: Let your members generate AI images inside your whop

The best way to discover which apps work for your audience is to browse the [Whop App Store](/apps/docs/whop-apps/whop-app-store), install apps that seem relevant, and experiment with different combinations. You can always add or remove apps based on what your members actually use and value.
