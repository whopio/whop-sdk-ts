Apps are the building blocks for your business on Whop. 

Here’s how it works: You create your own whop, then pick and choose which apps to include. Want a chat room for your community? Add the **Chat** app. Selling a course? Add the **Course** app. 

There are dozens of apps to choose from, and you can add any of them with just one click.

Each app becomes a feature that your members get access to when they join your whop.
