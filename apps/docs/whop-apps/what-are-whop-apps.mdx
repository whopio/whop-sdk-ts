Imagine being able to sell any software as your own product, complete with built-in payments, user management, and mobile access. That's exactly what Whop apps enable.

Use apps to give your customers new experiences or to level up internal operations for your business.

## What types of apps are there?

Whop apps fall into two broad themes:

- **Community-focused apps** – Chat, courses, live events, forums, and other social experiences that keep members engaged. See the full list in [Apps for communities](/apps/docs/whop-apps/apps-for-communities).
- **Business-focused apps** – Market data feeds, SaaS tools, and utilities that open new revenue streams or streamline operations. Explore examples in [Apps for businesses](/apps/docs/whop-apps/apps-for-businesses).

## Build your own app

If you can’t find the exact experience you need, build it.
