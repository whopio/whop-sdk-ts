## Dispute process overview

A dispute happens when a customer contacts their bank or credit card company to challenge a payment they made to your whop. Here's the basic process:

- **Customer files dispute** → Card issuer investigates
- **Whop gets notified** → You see it in [Dispute fighter](/apps/docs/payments/dispute-fighter)
- **Money gets frozen** → Disputed amount \+ \$15 fee taken immediately from your balance
- **You submit evidence** → 7-21 days to respond
- **Card issuer decides** → Takes 2-3 months for final decision

### Common reasons customers file disputes

- They don't recognize the charge on their statement
- They think the transaction was fraudulent
- They're unhappy with what they got
- They tried to cancel but got charged anyway
- They got something different from what was promised

<Tip>
  If a customer reaches out to you directly about a problem, that's actually great news. You can fix their issue right away and avoid the whole dispute mess. Disputes only get messy when customers go straight to their bank instead of talking to you first.

## How to win disputes

Knowing how card issuers decide disputes helps you send better proof and win more often.

<Warning>
  Even with Whop's help, the card issuer has the final call on whether you'll win or lose the dispute.
</Warning>

### The decision process

1. **Initial review:** The card issuer looks into the customer's complaint
2. **Submitting evidence:** You have 7-21 days to send your evidence (depending on the card company)
3. **Evaluation:** The card issuer reviews all evidence and makes a decision (usually 60-75 days)
4. **Final answer:** You either win or lose the dispute

### What card issuers look for in your evidence

- **Proof of transaction:** Clear records showing the customer sent the payment
- **Delivery proof:** Evidence you gave them what they paid for
- **Customer chats:** Any messages between you and the customer
- **Terms of Service:** Proof the customer agreed to your terms
- **Return policy:** Your clearly written return policy

## Early dispute alerts setup

Early dispute alerts give you advance warning when a customer is about to file a dispute, allowing you to resolve the issue before it becomes an official dispute that hurts your account.

### How Early dispute alerts work

- **Early warning system:** When a customer starts a dispute, you get notified immediately. This gives you a chance to resolve the issue before it becomes an official dispute on your record.
- **Automatic refunds save money:** Any transaction under your set amount gets automatically refunded, saving you from paying chargeback fees that can be much more expensive than the refund itself.
- **Clearer transaction info:** Each purchase shows up on the customer's bank statement with a clear description and website link, helping customers remember what they bought and reducing confusion-based disputes.

<Warning>
  You'll be charged \$29 per Early dispute alert.
</Warning>

### How to set up Early dispute alerts

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Dispute fighter**
2. Click **Early dispute alert**
