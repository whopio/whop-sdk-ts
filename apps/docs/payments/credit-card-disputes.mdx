In this guide, you'll learn everything you need to know about credit card disputes — from what they are to how to win them.

## What is a credit card dispute?

A dispute happens when a customer contacts their bank or credit card company to challenge a payment they made to your whop. Here's the basic process:

- Customer files a dispute →
- Card issuer looks into it →
- Your money gets withheld →
- Card issuer makes a decision

When someone disputes a charge on your Whop, here's what happens:

1. Whop gets notified through our payment system
2. The disputed amount plus a \$15 dispute fee gets taken from your Whop balance right away
3. You get an explanation of what happened and can see the customer's complaint in the [Dispute fighter](/apps/docs/manage-your-whop/dispute-fighter)
4. You can fight back by sending proof to counter the dispute
5. The card issuer makes the final call (this takes 2-3 months)

### Common reasons customers file disputes

- They don't recognize the charge on their statement
- They think the transaction was fraudulent
- They're unhappy with what they got
- They tried to cancel but got charged anyway
- They got something different from what was promised

<Tip>
  If a customer reaches out to you directly about a problem, that's actually great news. You can fix their issue right away and avoid the whole dispute mess. Disputes only get messy when customers go straight to their bank instead of talking to you first.
</Tip>

## Why disputes are bad for your business

Disputes can really hurt your business if you get too many.

### Financial problems

- **Your cash gets taken immediately:** Money is withdrawn from your account as soon as someone files a dispute
- **Dispute fees:** There's a \$15 fee for each dispute, even if you win
- **Account holds:** Too many disputes can freeze 25-100% of your money

### Business problems

- **Account limits:** High dispute rates can mess with your payment processing
- **Getting suspended:** Really bad cases can shut down your whop
- **Credit card company penalties:** Visa and Mastercard monitor your dispute rates and can fine you or ban your business

### Whop's dispute rate expectations

To maintain a trustworthy marketplace, you must keep your dispute rate below 2%.

We use a Dispute Risk Score (ranging from 0-5\+) to monitor your account health:

- **0-2:** You're good, no problems
- **2-3:** We hold 25% of your balance
- **3-4:** We hold 50% of your balance
- **4-5:** We hold 75% of your balance
- **5\+:** Your account gets suspended

You can check your Dispute Risk Score in your Creator Dashboard, and we'll email you if it exceeds 2.

<Tip>
  The bottom line: Keeping your dispute rate low is essential for keeping your business running.

## How disputes are decided

Knowing how card issuers decide disputes helps you send better proof and win more often.

<Warning>
  Even with Whop's help, the card issuer has the final call on whether you'll win or lose the dispute.
</Warning>

### The decision process

1. **Initial review:** The card issuer looks into the customer's complaint
2. **Submitting evidence:** You have 7-21 days to send your evidence (depending on the card company)
3. **Evaluation:** The card issuer reviews all evidence and makes a decision (usually 60-75 days)
4. **Final answer:** You either win or lose the dispute

### What card issuers look for in your evidence

- **Proof of transaction:** Clear records showing the customer sent the payment
- **Delivery proof:** Evidence you gave them what they paid for
- **Customer chats:** Any messages between you and the customer
- **Terms of Service:** Proof the customer agreed to your terms
- **Return policy:** Your clearly written return policy

### Types of disputes you can't challenge

There are some disputes you can't challenge and automatically lose. This includes:

- Certain fraud cases (depending on the card company)
- Disputes from some countries due to local laws
- Cases where the card issuer won't let you submit evidence

<Tip>
  Even if a customer says they cancelled their dispute, you still need to submit evidence to actually win it.
</Tip>

## When funds are taken and returned

Here's how the money moves during disputes.

### When a dispute is filed

- Money gets taken from your Whop balance right away
- A \$15 dispute fee also gets charged
- Money stays frozen for the whole process (usually 2-3 months)
- You can't send a regular refund while a dispute is happening

### Why dispute amounts might differ

The dispute amount might be different from what they originally paid:

- **Currency changes:** Exchange rates shift between when they paid and when they disputed
- **Partial disputes:** Customer only disputes part of what they bought
- **Multiple charges:** Card issuer combines several disputed payments into one
- **Partially refunded payments:** Customer disputes the full amount even after getting some money back

### Getting your money back

**If you win the dispute:** The disputed amount is returned to your Whop balance

**If you lose the dispute:** No money is returned to you, and the customer receives their refund from their card issuer

<Tip>
  Since disputes can take months and your money gets frozen immediately, plan for this in your cash flow. If you get a lot of disputes, you might need more money saved up to keep operating.

## Dispute protection with Early dispute alerts

Whop's Early dispute alerts are designed to protect your business from disputes before they impact your dispute rate, saving you both time and money.

### What are Early dispute alerts?

Early dispute alerts give you advance warning when a customer is about to file a dispute, allowing you to resolve the issue before it becomes an official dispute that hurts your account.

### How Early dispute alerts work

- **Early warning system:** When a customer starts a dispute, you get notified immediately. This gives you a chance to resolve the issue before it becomes an official dispute on your record.
- **Automatic refunds save money:** Any transaction under your set amount gets automatically refunded, saving you from paying chargeback fees that can be much more expensive than the refund itself.
- **Clearer transaction info:** Each purchase shows up on the customer's bank statement with a clear description and website link, helping customers remember what they bought and reducing confusion-based disputes.

<Warning>
  You'll be charged \$29 per Early dispute alert.
