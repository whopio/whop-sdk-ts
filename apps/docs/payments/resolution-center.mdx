The Resolution center is where you can review and respond to customer refund claims.

## How the Resolution center works

Here’s what happens when a customer opens a claim:

1. **Customer opens a claim**
   - They explain the issue and choose a reason
   - They can upload up to 3 files (screenshots, videos, receipts)
2. **You receive a notification**
   - Whop sends you an email
   - The case appears in your **Resolution center**
3. **You respond**
   - Chat directly with the customer
   - Click **Accept**, **Deny**, or **Request more info**

<Info>
  Whop automatically uploads user logs for every case. In these, you can see:

  - When the user bought access to your Whop
  - If they agreed to your Terms of Service and Refund policy
  - If they claimed access to your Whop
  - If they engaged with your Whop
</Info>

4. **A decision is made**
   - If resolved between you and the customer, the case is closed
   - If the case is not resolves or you don’t respond within 7 days, Whop will step in and make a decision

## Set up auto respond for small refunds

You can set up automatic refunds for smaller claims:

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Resolution center**
2. Click **Auto respond**
3. Pick the amount for which auto-refunds are sent:
   - This can be set under **Auto-refund card payments below**
   - And **Auto-refund PayPal payments below**
4. (Optional) Add a custom message your customers will see when they get auto-refunded

## Escalations and appeals

**If you don't respond within 7 days:**

- Whop reviews the case and decides based on all available info
- Both you and the customer are notified of the outcome

**Appeal process:**

- If either you or your customer disagrees with a decision, either party can appeal
- Whop will review the case again
- That decision is final and cannot be appealed further

## Notifications

Whop will email you when:

- A customer opens a new dispute
- A customer replies to your request for more info
- A case is esolved, escalated, or appealed
- Final decisions are made

If you're not getting emails from the Resolution center, go to **Dashboard** \> **Settings** \> **Notifications** and turn on the **Resolution center** toggle.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many cases can a customer open?">
    Customers can open a case within 120 days of each payment they've made. For example, if a customer has made three payments, they can open three cases. However, only one case can be opened per payment. Once a case is closed and all appeals have been exhausted, the case cannot be reopened.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a customer open a case for a payment that has already been refunded?">
    No. When a payment is refunded, no further case can be opened.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are all payments eligible for the Resolution center?">
    Only fiat payments are eligible for the Resolution center. Payments made with cryptocurrency via Coinbase Commerce are not eligible since they are irreversible and non-refundable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when Whop decides in favor of the customer?">
    Whop will either refund the customer on your behalf (which will be automatically processed) or decide to credit the customer's Whop Balance (which you do not incur a cost for). The result will be clearly communicated to you and the customer through the Resolution center timeline for the case.
