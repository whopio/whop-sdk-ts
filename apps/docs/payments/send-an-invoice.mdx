Whether your business sends customers an invoice upfront for providing a specific service, or the customer requires an invoice before making payment,
you can create an invoice on Whop in a few seconds.

## How to create and send an invoice

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to 'Invoices'" titleSize="h3">
    - Go to your **Dashboard** and click **Invoices** in the **Payments** section.
    - Click **+ Create invoice**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add customer details" titleSize="h3">
    - Click the **Find or add a customer** dropdown menu.
    - Select an existing customer, or click **+ Add new customer** and enter their email and name.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add due date" titleSize="h3">
    Click the **Due date** dropdown and select when the invoice will become due for payment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add description" titleSize="h3">
    Add a clear description of what you're billing for (your customer will see this on their invoice).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add amount" titleSize="h3">
    - Choose whether it's a **One-time** or **Recurring** payment:
      - **One-time:** The customer receives a single invoice with the amount you set.
      - **Recurring:** Creates a subscription. The first payment is invoiced; all following payments are charged automatically (customers receive receipts, not new invoices). If you select **Recurring**, choose how often the customer is charged (e.g. every 7 days, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or a custom cycle).
    - **Enter the amount:** Type in the price and use the dropdown to set the currency.
    - **Configure advanced options:**
      - **Ask questions before checkout:** Collect information from customers before purchase.
      - **Redirect after checkout:** Send customers to a specific page after they complete checkout.
      - **Payment methods:** Choose how the customer can pay â€” card, ACH, platform balance, financing (apply for access), PayPal, or crypto (setup required).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pass processing fees (optional)" titleSize="h3">
    You can pass payment processing fees on to the customer by checking the box next to **Pass payment processing fees on to the customer**. When checked, fees will be added to the total invoice amount.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send invoice" titleSize="h3">
    When you are happy with the email and checkout link previews, and you're sure all the details are correct, click **Send invoice**. Your customer will immediately receive the invoice in their email inbox.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How reminders work

When an invoice passes the due date, Whop's invoice reminders kick in at certain intervals. We'll remind your customers after:
- 3 days
- 7 days
- 14 days
- 30 days
- 60 days

If the invoice is still unpaid after 120 days, it will be automatically voided.

## How to cancel / void an invoice

1. Go to your Invoices dashboard.
2. Find the invoice you want to void.
3. Click the three-dot menu on the right and select **Void invoice**.
4. Once voided, the invoice can no longer be paid.

## How to download an invoice

1. Go to your **Invoices** dashboard.
2. Find the invoice you want to download.
3. Click the three-dot menu on the right and select **Download PDF**.

## Tracking invoices in your dashboard

Your dashboard gives you a full view of every invoice and its status across all your customers, so you always know what's been paid and what's still outstanding.

### Statuses

- **Open:** The invoice has been created and delivered to the customer, but it has not been paid yet.
- **Paid:** The invoice was paid by the customer.
- **Past due:** The invoice was not paid by the due date. It can still be paid for up to 120 days after the due date.
- **Void:** The invoice was either canceled manually or automatically after being past due for 120 days.

### Customize your invoices dashboard

- **Filters:** Use the filters at the top of the table to only see invoices by status (e.g. Open, Paid, Past due) or by collection method (e.g. Send invoice vs Charge automatically).
- **Edit the table view:** Click Edit in the top right to choose which columns to display, such as invoice number, customer name, email, created date, or due date. Drag and drop to reorder columns so the most important details appear first.

### Export invoices for your records

1. Click **Export** in the top right of the dashboard.
2. Choose your time zone (local or UTC).
3. Select a date range (today, last 7 days, last month, or custom).
4. Pick which columns to include, or export all.
5. Click **Export** to download a CSV file you can use for accounting or record-keeping.
