Learn what causes payment declines, what Whop does to recover them, and how you or your customers can fix declined payments.

## Why has a payment been declined?

Common reasons for payment declines:

- The customer’s card has insufficient funds
- The card is expired or the details entered are incorrect
- The bank blocked the charge or flagged it for fraud
- The transaction was blocked due to international restrictions
- The customer hit their spending limit or daily cap

## What happens when a payment is declined

When a customer's payment gets declined or fails, Whop takes several steps to try and recover the payment:

- **The subscription status changes to Past due**: This means the payment needs attention, but doesn't immediately cancel access
  - You can view Past due payments by going to **Dashboard** \> **Payments**, clicking **Status** and selecting only **Past due**
- **We email the customer**: Your customers receive emails prompting them to update their payment information
- **We retry the payment: **Whop automatically retries the charge over a 5-day period
- **Access may be temporarily paused**: Depending on your settings, your customer might lose access to your whop until the payment goes through
  - Go to **Dashboard** \> **Settings** \> **Checkout** and choose whether you want members to have **Access while past due** or not
- **Subscription is canceled**: If the payment still fails after 5 days, the subscription is canceled automatically

## What you can do to fix a declined payment

When a payment is declined, you can help the customer update their payment method and manually retry the payment from your dashboard. 

**Step 1: Ask the customer to update their payment method**

- Contact the customer to confirm they have sufficient funds and a working payment method
- To update their payment method, ask them to follow these steps:
  1. Go to https://whop.com/@me/settings/memberships/inactive
  2. Click the **card** button on the affected subscription
  3. Select **Update payment**
  4. Add the new card details and save

**Step 2: Manually retry the payment from your dashboard**

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Payments**
2. Click **Status** and select only **Failed**
3. Select the failed payment
4. Click **Retry payment**

When the payment processes successfully, Whop restores the customer’s access automatically.
