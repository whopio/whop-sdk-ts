When a customer's payment doesn't go through, Whop automatically tries to recover it and gives customers several chances to update their payment info before canceling their membership.

Understanding how payment declines work helps you keep customers happy and revenue flowing when payment issues arise.

## What happens when a payment declines

When a customer's payment gets declined or fails, Whop automatically takes several steps to try and recover the payment:

- **The subscription status changes to Past due**: This means the payment needs attention, but doesn't immediately cancel access
  - You can view Past due payments by going to **Dashboard** \> **Payments**, clicking **Status** and selecting only **Past due**
- **Automatic email reminders are sent**: Your customers receive emails prompting them to update their payment information
- **Access may be temporarily paused**: Depending on your settings, customer access might stop working until the payment goes through.
  - Go to **Dashboard** \> **Settings** \> **Checkout** and choose whether you want members to have **Access while past due** or not

## Whop's automatic retry system

Whop gives customers **5 days** to fix payment problems before automatically canceling their membership.

During these 5 days:

- We automatically retry the payment in the background
- Customers can update their payment method or try again manually
- If payment still fails after 5 days, we automatically cancel the membership

This system helps you recover most failed payments while ensuring customers don't receive free access indefinitely.

## How customers can update their payment method

Customers can easily update their payment information without canceling their subscription.

To update the payment method:

- Go to https://whop.com/@me/settings/memberships/inactive
- Click the **card** button on the affected subscription
- Select **Update payment**
- Add the new card details and save

<Tip>
  Updating the payment method does not cancel the subscription â€” it just provides new payment information for future charges.

## How to retry failed payments manually

If a payment failed and automatic retries haven't worked yet, you can manually retry the payment:

To retry a failed payment:

- Contact the customer with the **Failed** payment to ensure they have sufficient funds and a working payment method
- They can update their payment method by going to https://whop.com/@me/settings/payment-methods/ and clicking **Add payment method**
- Go to **Dashboard** \> **Payments**
- Click **Status** and select only **Failed**
- Select the failed payment
- Click **Retry payment**

When the payment processes successfully, customer access is restored automatically.
