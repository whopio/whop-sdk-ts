## International payouts

Creators outside the US need to set up a bank account that accepts the currency of their registered country.

On Whop Payments, Whop is the _Merchant of Record_, and our system automatically converts all currencies to the currency of the geography you initially chose when you set up your Whop organization.

- This means that, even if you accept payments in USD, Whop automatically converts the USD payments to your local currency before sending payouts.
- Payouts will NOT successfully go through to a USD-accepting bank account if the bank account is located in a country where USD is not the local currency.

<Tip>
Your payout country can be changed for an existing Whop. 
To switch payout countries, navigate to your payouts & click the 3 dots on the top right. 
Click "change payout country.

## Troubleshooting payouts

### Common payout statuses

- **Requested:** A withdrawal has been initiated and is awaiting approval
- **Processing / In Transit:** Payment is processing (takes 1–5 business days)
- **Completed:** Funds sent by Whop, awaiting bank processing
- **Canceled:** Your payout has failed. 

### Payout timing & processing delays

**Standard timing:**

- When you make a sale, the money will be available for withdrawal in 1–4 business days.
- Once withdrawn, allow up to 10 business days for the payout to be processed and arrive in your bank.

**If a payout fails:**

- The reason will be shown in the payout timeline. 
- When this happens, the failed amount is automatically re-added to your available balance. 

**How to retry a failed payout:** 
1. Review the failure reason and update any necessary information (like bank details or currency settings). 
2. Once updated, you can retry your payout by clicking **Withdraw** in the Payouts tab on your Dashboard.

You can also click on the payout to see more information on the payout timeline and why the payout may have failed.

**Common reasons for failed payouts:**

- Your bank account is not in the local currency of the country where you registered your Whop
- You entered your bank account information incorrectly

**To replace your bank account:**

- Go to your **Dashboard** \> **Payouts**.
- Click on **Withdraw**.
- Navigate to send payout to and then **Add new account.**
- Input your new bank account details and click **Add** (bottom right).

### If a payout says "Completed" but money hasn't arrived

This means the payout has been processed on Whop's end.

1. Allow up to 5 business days (excluding weekends and bank holidays) for your bank to process it.
2. If it takes longer, click on the payout to see the payout timeline. A Trace ID will be provided.

**To track or trace your payout:**

1. Contact your bank's customer service.
2. Share the Trace ID, payout date, amount, and payor name (Whop).
