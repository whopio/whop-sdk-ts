Checkout links let you send customers straight to a payment page to buy your products or services. You can offer free access, one-time payments, or recurring payment subscriptions.

## Where to find and copy checkout links

When you've created your product, you can generate a checkout link for it.

- Go to your **Dashboard** \> **Checkout links** to view all your existing links
- Click **Copy link** next to any product to copy its checkout URL
- Click **\+ Create checkout link** to generate a new checkout link for any product

With your checkout link, you're ready to start processing payments with Whop.
