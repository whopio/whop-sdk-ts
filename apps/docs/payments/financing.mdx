Offer your customers flexible payment options with buy now, pay later services like Splitit, Sezzle, Klarna, AfterPay, and Zip Pay.

Give your customers the flexibility to split their purchases into monthly installments while you get paid upfront. 

## What is financing and how it works

Financing lets customers purchase your products without paying the full cost upfront. Instead, they can split any one-time purchase into monthly installments.

How it benefits you:

- **Increase conversions**: Remove price barriers for customers
- **Boost average order value**: Customers can afford higher-priced items
- **Reach new customers**: Appeal to budget-conscious buyers
- **Get paid immediately**: Receive full payment upfront (minus standard fees)
- **Zero management**: The financing provider handles everything

The buy now, pay later providers handle customer approval, payment collection, and any issues that arise.

## Available financing options

Whop partners with five financing providers. Depending on your business, you may qualify for some or all of these options:

- **Splitit**
- **Sezzle**
- **AfterPay**
- **Klarna**
- **Zip Pay**

<Tip>
  Depending on your business, you may be able to access some or all of these options.
