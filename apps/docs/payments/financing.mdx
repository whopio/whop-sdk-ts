Give your customers the flexibility to split their purchases into monthly instalments while you get paid upfront.

When your business has been approved, financing options are added to your checkout automatically. 

## Available financing options

Whop partners with five financing providers. Depending on your business, you may qualify for some or all of these options:

- **Splitit**
- **Sezzle**
- **AfterPay**
- **Klarna**
- **Zip Pay**

## How to apply for financing

There are two ways to apply for financing:

### Option 1: Direct application

1. Fill out the [financing application form](https://hunterd.app.n8n.cloud/form/e9e21a0c-91d5-4cda-9b14-a9506be5af44)
2. Answer a few questions about your business
3. Wait for approval confirmation via Whop DM

### Option 2: Apply from your dashboard

1. Go to your **Dashboard**
2. Click **Checkout links** in the left sidebar
3. Click **\+ Create checkout link**
4. Select **One-time** as your pricing type
5. Under **Payment methods**, click **Apply for financing**
6. Complete the application form

## Eligibility requirements

To qualify for financing options, your business must meet these requirements:

### Basic setup requirements

- **Whop Payments account**: Fully set up and verified
  - Go to **Payouts** in your dashboard to complete setup
- **Complete store page**: We need to understand what you're selling and how you fulfill orders

### Business requirements

- **Eligible category**: No gambling, sports betting, pure trading signals, credit offers, or adult content
- **Low dispute rate**: Under 2% disputes over the last 90 days
- **Processing volume**: At least \$30,000 processed from 10\+ different customers in the last 90 days
- **Processing statements**: If you're new to Whop, provide processing statements (NOT bank statements) from your previous processor showing transaction and dispute data over the last 90 days.

<Tip>
  You'll receive a Whop DM when your business is approved and financing is enabled. If you haven't heard back about your application, check your email for requests for additional documentation or application updates.

## How it works for customers

When financing is enabled:

1. Financing options appear automatically on your checkout page
2. Customers choose their preferred provider (e.g. Klarna, AfterPay)
3. Customers are redirected to the financing provider for instant approval
4. They complete their purchase through the financing platform

You can control which financing options appear on each of your checkout links through your pricing settings.

## Keep your financing access

Keep your financing options by maintaining healthy business metrics:

**Reserve fund (Splitit only)**

- 15% of every Splitit transaction is held in your Whop balance for 180 days
- This shows Splitit that you can cover potential disputes
- Track release dates on your **Payouts** page

**Dispute rate monitoring**

- View dispute rates for each financing partner on your **Health report** (in the **Payouts** section)
- Get email alerts when dispute rates hit warning levels:
  - Klarna: 0.5% warning
  - All others: 1% warning

<Tip>
  When you receive an email alert, take extra precautions to prevent further disputes.
</Tip>

**Dispute rate limits**

Stay under these thresholds to keep your financing access:

- **Klarna:** Under 1% dispute rate
- **All other providers:** Under 2% dispute rate

Exceeding these limits will result in loss of financing access for that provider.

## Troubleshooting

If financing isn't showing on your checkout links after approval, check these common issues:

**Transaction too large**

- Sezzle: \$2,500 limit
- AfterPay: \$4,000 limit
- Splitit: \$65,000 limit

**Wrong pricing type**

- Financing only works with one-time payments, not subscriptions

**Location restrictions**

- Sezzle, Klarna, and AfterPay only show for US and Canadian customers

**Dispute rate too high**

- Check your Health report - you may have exceeded the 2% dispute threshold

**Incomplete setup**

- Ensure your Whop Payments account is fully configured
- Verify your store page is complete with clear product descriptions
