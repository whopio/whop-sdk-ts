If your customer needs an invoice before they pay, you can send an invoice to their email address directly in your dashboard (on both web and mobile).

## **How to create and send an invoice**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to ‘Invoices’" titleSize="h3">
    - Go to your **Dashboard** and click \*\*Invoices \*\*in the **Payments** section.
    - Click **\+ Create invoice.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add customer details" titleSize="h3">
    - Click the **Find or add a customer** dropdown menu.
    - Select an existing customer in the dropdown, or click **\+ Add new customer** and enter their email and name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add due date" titleSize="h3">
    Click the dropdown menu under **Due date** and select when the invoice will become due for payment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add description" titleSize="h3">
    Add a clear description of what you’re billing for - your customer will see this on their invoice.
  </Step>
  <Step title=" Add amount" titleSize="h3">
    -  Choose whether it’s a **One-time** or **Recurring** payment:
      - \*\*One-time: \*\*The customer receives a single invoice with the amount you set.
      - \*\*Recurring: \*\*Creates a subscription. An invoice is sent for the first payment, and all following payments are charged automatically (customers receive receipts for these payments, not new invoices). If you select _Recurring_, you’ll need to choose how often the customer is charged (e.g. every 7 days, monthly, quarterly, yearly, or a custom billing cycle).
    - **Enter the amount:** Type in the price and use the dropdown to set the currency.
    - Configure advanced options:
      - **Ask questions before checkout:** Collect information from customers before they purchase.
      - \*\*Redirect after checkout: \*\*Send customers to a specific page after they complete checkout.
    - **Payment methods:** Choose how your customer can pay the invoice - options include card, ACH, platform balance, financing (apply for access), PayPal, or crypto (setup required).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decide whether to pass processing fees onto client" titleSize="h3">
    You can pass payment processing fees on to the customer by checking the box next to **Pass payment processing fees on to the customer**. When this is checked, payment fees will be added to the total invoice amount.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send invoice" titleSize="h3">
    When you are happy with the Email and Checkout link previews, and you’re sure all the details are correct, click Send invoice. Your customer will immediately receive the invoice in their email inbox.
  </Step>
</Steps>


## **How reminders work**

If a client hasn’t paid, Whop automatically sends reminder emails at 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 days past the due date. 

If the invoice is still unpaid after 120 days, it will be automatically voided.

## **How to cancel / void an invoice**

1. Go to your Invoices dashboard.
2. Find the invoice you want to void.
3. Click the three-dot menu on the right and select Void invoice.
4. When voided, the invoice can no longer be paid.

## **How to download an invoice**

1. Go to your **Invoices** dashboard.
2. Find the invoice you want to download.
3. Click the three-dot menu on the right and select **Download PDF**.

## **Tracking invoices in your dashboard**

Your dashboard gives you a full view of every invoice and its status across all your customers, so you always know what’s been paid and what’s still outstanding.

### **Statuses**

- **Open:** Invoice has been created and sent, but not yet paid.
- **Paid:** Customer has completed payment.
- **Past due: **Payment hasn’t been made by the due date.
- **Void: **Invoice is canceled or automatically voided after 120 days without payment.

### **Customize your invoices dashboard**

- **Filters: **Use the filters at the top of the table to only see invoices by status (e.g. Open, Paid, Past due) or by collection method (e.g. Send invoice vs Charge automatically).
- **Edit the table view: **Click Edit in the top right to choose which columns to display, such as invoice number, customer name, email, created date, or due date. Drag and drop to reorder columns so the most important details appear first.

### **Export invoices for your records**

1. Click **Export** in the top right of the dashboard.
2. Choose your time zone (local or UTC).
3. Select a date range (today, last 7 days, last month, or custom).
4. Pick which columns to include, or export all.
5. Click **Export** to download a CSV file you can use for accounting or record-keeping.
