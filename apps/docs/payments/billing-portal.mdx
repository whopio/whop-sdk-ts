The Whop billing portal is a self-service page where your customers can view and manage their memberships, update payment methods, view billing history, and handle subscription changes — all without contacting support.

## What customers can do in the billing portal

The billing portal gives your customers full control over their memberships:

- **View membership details**: See active plans, renewal dates, and billing cycles
- **Update payment methods**: Add, remove, or change credit cards and other payment methods
- **View billing history**: Access past invoices and receipts
- **Cancel memberships**: Self-service cancellation without contacting support
- **Transfer memberships**: Move memberships to another account
- **Manage subscriptions**: Pause or modify recurring billing

<Tip>
  Providing customers with direct access to the billing portal reduces support
  inquiries and improves customer satisfaction by giving them instant control
  over their memberships.
</Tip>

## How to provide the billing portal URL to your customers

Developers can access the billing portal URL through the Whop API. Each membership has a unique `manage_url` field that links directly to that customer's billing portal.

When you retrieve a membership through the API, the `manage_url` field contains the billing portal link. The URL will look like:

```
https://whop.com/billing/manage/mber_*************/
```

<Info>
  The billing portal URL is unique to each membership and is automatically
  authenticated. Customers who click the link will be securely logged into their
  membership management page.

## Common use cases

### Reducing cancellation support tickets

Instead of handling cancellation requests manually, direct customers to their billing portal:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Customer requests cancellation" titleSize="h3">
    A customer emails or messages your support team asking to cancel their
    membership.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send billing portal link" titleSize="h3">
    Reply with their unique billing portal URL where they can self-serve: *"You
    can cancel your membership anytime through your billing portal: [link]"*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customer cancels directly" titleSize="h3">
    The customer visits the portal and cancels their membership themselves — no
    back-and-forth needed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payment method updates

When a payment fails or a card expires, send customers to the billing portal to update their payment method.

### Membership transfers

Customers who want to transfer their membership to another account can do so through the billing portal without requiring administrator intervention.

<Warning>
  Never share a customer's billing portal URL publicly or with other users. Each
  URL grants full access to manage that specific membership.
</Warning>
