The billing portal is a self-service page where your users can manage their memberships, update payment methods, view billing history, and handle cancellations.

## What's in the portal

Your users get a fully-functional management interface with:

- **View membership details**: Active plans, renewal dates, and billing cycles
- **Update payment methods**: Add, remove, or change credit cards and other payment methods
- **View billing history**: Past invoices and receipts
- **Cancel memberships**: Self-service cancellation (saves you support tickets)
- **Transfer memberships**: Move memberships between accounts
- **Manage subscriptions**: Pause or modify recurring billing

<Tip>
  The billing portal handles all the complexity of subscription management for
  you. Just grab the URL from the API and make it accessible for your users to
  manage subscriptions on their own.
</Tip>

## Getting the billing portal URL

Each membership has a `manage_url` field that you can grab from the API. It's a unique, authenticated link that takes users straight to their billing portal.

When you retrieve a membership through the API, the `manage_url` field contains the billing portal link. The URL looks something like:

```
https://whop.com/billing/manage/mber_*************/
```

<Info>
  Each URL is unique to a membership and the user can only access that link if
  they are logged in and belong to that membership.

## Common use cases

### Handling cancellations

Instead of manually canceling subscriptions, just send users their billing portal link:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User wants to cancel" titleSize="h3">
    A user emails you asking to cancel their membership.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send the link" titleSize="h3">
    Make this url accessible to them in your app, and tell them where to find
    it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Done" titleSize="h3">
    They cancel it themselves. No back-and-forth, no manual work for you.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payment method updates

When a payment fails or a card expires, just point users to the portal to update their payment info.

### Membership transfers

Users can transfer memberships to other accounts directly through the portal. No admin work needed.
