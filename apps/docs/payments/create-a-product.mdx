Products are how you package and price your offer on Whop. You can set up free access, one-time payments, or recurring subscriptions for people to access your whop.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up your product details" titleSize="h3">
    Configure the core details of your product:

      - **Free**: Give customers free access to your product
      - **One-time**: Charge customers once for lifetime access
      - **Recurring**: Set up monthly or yearly subscriptions
    - **Choose currency**: Select the currency you want to charge in
    - **Set your price**: Enter how much customers will pay
      - If you chose recurring, also choose your billing cycle length (weekly, monthly, yearly)
    - **Configure advanced options** (optional):
      - **Stock**: Limit how many people can purchase this product
      - **Add a waitlist**: Users enter payment details but aren’t charged until you approve them
      - **Ask questions before checkout**: Collect information from customers before they purchase
      - **Auto-expire access**: Automatically remove access after a set time period
      - **Redirect after checkout**: Send customers to a specific page after they complete checkout
      - **Add internal name**: A name only you can see on your dashboard
      - **Visibility**: Make this product visible on your public whop store page
    - **Choose payment methods**: Select what customers can pay with
      - Credit/debit card
      - Bank transfer (ACH)
