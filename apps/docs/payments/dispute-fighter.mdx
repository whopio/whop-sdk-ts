## Dispute fees

Here's what happens financially when someone files a dispute:

- Whop immediately debits the disputed amount from your account
- You're charged a \$15 dispute fee
- Your dispute rate increases, which can affect your account standing
- The disputed funds are held during the investigation process

**If you win**: The disputed amount is returned to your Whop balance

**If you lose**: No money is returned and the customer receives their refund from their card issuer

## How Whop increases your chances of winning

The key to winning disputes is providing the right evidence that directly addresses the customer's specific complaint.

Whop automatically uploads relevant files and user logs to strengthen your case:

**Customer details**

- Email address (proves they have an account)
- Customer name (confirms identity)
- Billing address (matches payment method to prove legitimate purchase)

**Product details**

- Purchase date (shows exactly when they bought)
- Description (proves what they purchased and agreed to)
- Access activity log showing:
  - When they bought access
  - If they agreed to Terms of Service and Refund policy
  - If they claimed access
  - If they engaged with your content

**Cancellation policy**

- Policy disclosure (shows customer saw and agreed to cancellation rules)
- Your actual cancellation policy document

**Refund policy**

- Refund refusal explanation (explains why refund wasn't given)
- Policy disclosure (proves customer knew refund rules before buying)
- Your actual refund policy document

<Tip>
  Add your own evidence: Beyond what Whop automatically includes, you can upload supporting evidence and customer communications to make your case even stronger.

## Early dispute alerts

Set up **Early dispute alerts** to catch problems early.

To set up Early dispute alerts:

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Dispute fighter**
2. Click **Early dispute alert**
3. Enter the amount under **Refund transactions lower than**
4. Click **Save**

This helps you automatically refund small amounts before they become costly disputes.

### How Early dispute alerts work

- **Early warning system:** When a customer starts a dispute, you get notified immediately. This gives you a chance to resolve the issue before it becomes an official dispute on your record.
- **Automatic refunds save money:** Any transaction under your set amount gets automatically refunded, saving you from paying chargeback fees that can be much more expensive than the refund itself.
- **Clearer transaction info:** Each purchase shows up on the customer's bank statement with a clear description and website link, helping customers remember what they bought and reducing confusion-based disputes.

<Warning>
  You'll be charged \$29 per Early dispute alert.

## Managing your dispute rate

Whop uses a Dispute Risk Score to assess your account health, calculated using:

- Your dispute rate (heavily weighted)
- Auto-refund rate
- Resolution Center case submission rate

### Score ranges and consequences

- **Less than 2:** No restrictions
- **2-3:** 25% reserve on your balance
- **3-4:** 50% reserve on your balance
- **4-5:** 75% reserve on your balance
- **5\+:** Account suspension

**Key target:** Keep your dispute rate below 2% to maintain good standing.

### If your dispute rate gets too high

When your dispute rate exceeds acceptable limits:

- Your account may be placed on reserve (preventing withdrawals)
- Whop will review your account
- Further actions may include suspension of new sales
- Focus on addressing the root causes of disputes

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long do I have to respond to a dispute?">
    Each dispute has a deadline shown under Status in Dispute fighter. Response times vary for each dispute, so check them individually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I increase my chances of winning?">
    Provide evidence that directly answers the customer's complaint. Upload clear policies, show proof they received and used your product, and include screenshots of them using your service.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why did I lose a dispute?">
    The customer's bank makes the final decision, not Whop. Banks review all evidence you submit through Dispute fighter, but they decide the outcome. Whop gives you every tool to win, but we can't control the bank's decision.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a customer dispute the same payment multiple times?">
    Yes, but it's rare. Card companies and payment processors allow this - it's up to the payment company, and Whop can't prevent customers from trying again. Fight each dispute fully using Dispute fighter, even if it's the same purchase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I refund a disputed payment?">
    If it's become a full chargeback, you can't refund it. But if the customer contacts their bank and cancels the dispute, then you can give them a refund.
