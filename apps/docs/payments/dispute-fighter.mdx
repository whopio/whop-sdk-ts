Whop's dispute fighter helps you track, get ahead of, respond to, and resolve disputes.

## What happens when a dispute is filed?

When a customer files a dispute:

- Youâ€™re notified instantly of the dispute via Whop's **Dispute fighter**
- The disputed amount is immediately debited from your balance to make sure you can cover the cost of the dispute, along with a \$15 dispute fee
- Whop auto-uploads key evidence (like access logs, policy disclosures, and customer info) into the dispute fighter
- You can upload additional proof and submit your response directly from your dashboard
- The dispute status, outcome, and deadline are all tracked in **Dispute fighter**

## How to view and manage disputes

You can monitor and manage all your disputes in the **Dispute fighter**:

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Dispute fighter**
2. Click **Status** and choose from:
   - Needs response
   - Under review
   - Won
   - Lost

Track response deadlines and outcomes from this main view.

## How to respond to a dispute

## Dispute fees

- Whop immediately takes the disputed amount from your account
- You're charged a \$15 dispute fee
- The disputed funds are held during the investigation process to make sure you have enough to cover the dispute, and they are returned once the dispute is won 

**If you win**: The disputed amount is returned to your Whop balance

**If you lose**: The customer receives their refund from their card issuer - the money was already deducted to pay for this dispute, so no additional funds are taken from your account. 

## How to win disputes

### 1. Set up early dispute alerts (optional)

Early dispute alerts give you advance warning when a customer is about to file a dispute, allowing you to resolve the issue before it becomes an official dispute that hurts your account.

### How Early dispute alerts work

- **Early warning system:** When a customer starts a dispute, you get notified immediately. This gives you a chance to resolve the issue before it becomes an official dispute on your record.
- **Automatic refunds save money:** Any transaction under your set amount gets automatically refunded, saving you from paying chargeback fees that can be much more expensive than the refund itself.
- **Clearer transaction info:** Each purchase shows up on the customer's bank statement with a clear description and website link, helping customers remember what they bought and reducing confusion-based disputes.

**To set it up:**

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Dispute fighter**
2. Click **Early dispute alert**
3. Enter the amount under **Refund transactions lower than**
4. Click **Save**

<Warning>
  You'll be charged \$29 per Early dispute alert.
</Warning>

### 2. Fight disputes via the Dispute fighter 

Knowing how card issuers decide disputes helps you send better proof and win more often.

<Warning>
  Even with Whop's help, the card issuer has the final call on whether you'll win or lose the dispute.
</Warning>

### The decision process

1. **Initial review:** The card issuer looks into the customer's complaint
2. **Submitting evidence:** You have 7-21 days to send your evidence (depending on the card company)
3. **Evaluation:** The card issuer reviews all evidence and makes a decision (usually 60-75 days)
4. **Final answer:** You either win or lose the dispute

### What card issuers look for in your evidence

- **Proof of transaction:** Clear records showing the customer sent the payment
- **Delivery proof:** Evidence you gave them what they paid for
- **Customer chats:** Any messages between you and the customer
- **Terms of Service:** Proof the customer agreed to your terms
- **Return policy:** Your clearly written return policy

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long do I have to respond to a dispute?">
    Each dispute has a deadline shown under Status in Dispute fighter. Response times vary for each dispute, so check them individually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I increase my chances of winning?">
    Provide evidence that directly answers the customer's complaint. Upload clear policies, show proof they received and used your product, and include screenshots of them using your service.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why did I lose a dispute?">
    The customer's bank makes the final decision, not Whop. Banks review all evidence you submit through Dispute fighter, but they decide the outcome. Whop gives you every tool to win, but we can't control the bank's decision.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a customer dispute the same payment multiple times?">
    Yes, but it's rare. Card companies and payment processors allow this - it's up to the payment company, and Whop can't prevent customers from trying again. Fight each dispute fully using Dispute fighter, even if it's the same purchase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I refund a disputed payment?">
    If it's become a full chargeback, you can't refund it. But if the customer contacts their bank and cancels the dispute, then you can give them a refund.
