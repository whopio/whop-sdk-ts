## Dispute fees

Financial impact of a dispute:

- Whop immediately takes the disputed amount from your account
- You're charged a \$15 dispute fee
- The disputed funds are held during the investigation process
- Your dispute rate increases, which can affect your account standing

**If you win**: The disputed amount is returned to your Whop balance

**If you lose**: No money is returned and the customer receives their refund from their card issuer

## Early dispute alerts (Optional)

To set it up:

1. Go to **Dashboard** \> **Dispute fighter**
2. Click **Early dispute alert**
3. Enter the amount under **Refund transactions lower than**
4. Click **Save**

### How it works:

- Instant alert when a customer initiates a dispute
- Automatic refund if the amount is below your set threshold
- Saves you money by avoiding the \$15 chargeback fee

<Warning>
  You'll be charged \$29 per Early dispute alert.

## Managing your dispute rate

Whop uses a Dispute Risk Score to assess your account health, calculated using:

- Your dispute rate (heavily weighted)
- Auto-refund rate
- Resolution Center case submission rate

### If your dispute rate gets too high:

When your dispute rate exceeds acceptable limits:

- Your account may be placed on reserve (preventing withdrawals)
- Whop will review your account
- Further actions may include suspension of new sales
- Focus on addressing the root causes of disputes

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How long do I have to respond to a dispute?">
    Each dispute has a deadline shown under Status in Dispute fighter. Response times vary for each dispute, so check them individually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I increase my chances of winning?">
    Provide evidence that directly answers the customer's complaint. Upload clear policies, show proof they received and used your product, and include screenshots of them using your service.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why did I lose a dispute?">
    The customer's bank makes the final decision, not Whop. Banks review all evidence you submit through Dispute fighter, but they decide the outcome. Whop gives you every tool to win, but we can't control the bank's decision.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can a customer dispute the same payment multiple times?">
    Yes, but it's rare. Card companies and payment processors allow this - it's up to the payment company, and Whop can't prevent customers from trying again. Fight each dispute fully using Dispute fighter, even if it's the same purchase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I refund a disputed payment?">
    If it's become a full chargeback, you can't refund it. But if the customer contacts their bank and cancels the dispute, then you can give them a refund.
